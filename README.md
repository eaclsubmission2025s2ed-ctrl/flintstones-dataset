# FlintStoneStory Dataset

This is the official dataset for the EACL 2026 paper: **"S2ED: Executable Descriptions for Consistency-Aware Story Illustration"**.

This dataset was self-curated to evaluate the S2ED framework on the task of generating consistent, multi-panel story illustrations.

## Dataset Overview

The **FlintStoneStory** dataset is based on the classic animated series *The Flintstones*. The series provides rich, visually distinctive scenes and recurring characters, making it ideal for studying narrative coherence and identity consistency.

The dataset contains **166 stories** in total. Each story is presented as a single, self-contained `JSON` file.

## Data Format

Each `JSON` file in the `stories/` directory represents a single narrative and has the following structure:

* **`full_story`** (String): The complete, child-friendly narrative text for the episode.

  * *Example from `season 1_episode_1.json`*:
    `"On a sunny Sunday morning, Fred and Barney were bubbling with excitement as Barney showed off his new invention..."`

* **`global_characters_dict`** (Object): A knowledge base containing detailed descriptions of the main characters appearing in the story. This serves as the ground truth for character consistency.

  * *Example Entry for "Fred"*:
    `"Fred is a middle-aged man with a large and broad body... wearing a sleeveless, knee-length orange tunic with black spots..."`

* **`global_objects_dict`** (Object): A placeholder for global objects, currently empty in the provided data.

* **`captions_info`** (Array): An array of objects, where each object represents a single frame in the illustrated story. This is the primary output of the S2ED system. Each object in the array contains:

  * **`page_id`** (Integer): The sequential frame number, starting from 1.
  * **`caption`** (String): A short, 1-2 sentence summary of the events in that frame.

    * *Example (`page_id: 1`)*:
      `"On a sunny Sunday morning, Fred and Barney were bursting with excitement over Barney's new invention – the \"Flintstone Flyer!\""`
  * **`char_all_list`** (Array of Strings): A list of all characters mentioned in this frame's caption.
  * **`description`** (String): The final "Executable Description." This is a detailed, rich prompt generated by the S2ED framework, combining the caption with character knowledge and inferred visual cues. This description is intended to be used by a text-to-image model.

    * *Example (`page_id: 1`)*:
      `"Fred. Fred is a middle-aged man with a large and broad body... Barney. Barney is a short, stout man... A cheerful and energetic outdoor scene on a sunny Sunday morning where Fred and Barney are animatedly discussing..."`
