Wilma smiled and said, “Let’s explore first, Fred. There’s so much to see!” Pebbles giggled, bouncing up and down, “I want to find seashells!” As they walked along the sandy shore, they met two friendly strangers who offered them shiny gems. “Look at these pretty jewels!” one of them said, winking at Fred. “Let’s take some pictures!” said Barney, his cheerful smile lighting up his face. But soon, the strangers whispered to each other, planning something sneaky! When Fred picked up a shiny jewel, the strangers pretended to gasp, “He’s stealing!” Just then, Dino bounded over, barking happily at Fred. “No, Dino! I didn’t do it!” Fred exclaimed, looking worried. Wilma quickly stepped in, “We believe in Fred! You can’t trick us!” Betty nodded, “Friends don’t frame friends!” Pebbles added, “Yeah! Let’s show them the truth!” With a clever plan, they all worked together, using Barney’s camera to catch the strangers in their sneaky act. “Gotcha!” Fred said proudly as they showed the pictures to Mr. Slate, who was visiting Rockapulco too. “I see! You’re innocent, Fred!” Mr. Slate declared, smiling. The friends cheered, and Pebbles laughed, “Let’s have a beach party instead!” They spent the rest of the day playing games, bowling, and enjoying the sun, knowing that friendship and trust always shine brighter than any jewel!",
