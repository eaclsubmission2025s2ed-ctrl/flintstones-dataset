  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Fred was feeling extra loud and excited because he had a big meeting with Mr. Slate at the quarry. “I’ve got to ask for more break time, Barney!” Fred shouted, bouncing up and down. “Let’s go!” Barney, with a big smile, nodded eagerly, “Okay, Fred! Let’s do it!” But when they met Mr. Slate, the boss frowned. “I’m sorry, Fred, but I have to let you go to make the other workers happy,” he said sternly. Fred’s heart sank, and he left the quarry feeling sad. \n\nAt the park, Fred sat on a bench, grumbling. Suddenly, a cheerful man approached him. “What’s wrong?” he asked. Fred sighed, “I lost my job!” Just then, Wilma arrived with a delicious pie in her hands. “Try my pie, Fred!” she called with a smile. The man tasted it and exclaimed, “This is the best pie ever!” Soon, a crowd gathered and everyone wanted a slice! P.J. Safestone from Safestone Supermarkets saw them and rushed over. “I’ll buy 50 pies! No, wait! 500 pies!” he declared excitedly.\n\nFred’s eyes sparkled with joy, and he rushed home to tell Wilma. “We’re going to bake pies all day!” he cheered. Wilma smiled, “That sounds fun!” They baked and baked, with Pebbles giggling and Dino playfully helping by licking the mixing bowl. But soon, Fred noticed something strange. “Uh-oh, I’m losing money!” he said, scratching his head. He hurried back to Safestone, “Can we change the deal?” But Safestone shook his head. “Nope! You’re stuck with 500 pies!” \n\nFred felt overwhelmed, but Wilma hugged him tightly. “Don’t worry, Fred. We can share the pies with our friends!” she said cheerfully. Together with Barney and Betty, they handed out pies at the park. Everyone loved them! “Hooray for the best pies in Bedrock!” shouted Barney, and Fred felt happy again. They laughed, played, and shared pie slices, realizing that family and friends make everything better, even when things get a little sticky!",
