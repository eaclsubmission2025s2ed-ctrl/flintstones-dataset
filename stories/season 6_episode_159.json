What if we found treasure on the way home?\" Fred shouted, his eyes sparkling with imagination. Barney's face lit up with a big, cheerful smile. \"That would be amazing, Fred! Let's look!\" So, they pulled over to the side of the road, where a glimmering rock caught their attention. \"Look at that shiny stone!\" Fred exclaimed, picking it up. \"It must be worth a fortune!\" Barney nodded eagerly, his simple mind racing with dreams of riches. Just then, Fred's phone buzzed. It was Wilma calling, “Fred, remember that treasure isn’t just shiny rocks; it’s about family and friendship!” Fred paused, thinking hard. “You’re right, Wilma!” he said, suddenly feeling warm inside. But Barney, still excited, said, “Let’s keep looking, Fred!” As they searched, they began to argue about whose treasure it really was. Fred shouted, “I found it first!” and Barney replied, “But I helped you!” Just then, their playful pet Dino bounded over, wagging his tail and barking happily. “Dino, you’re right! Friends are the best treasure of all!” Fred laughed, giving Barney a friendly nudge. They hugged, realizing that the fun they had together was more important than any shiny rock. When they finally returned home, Pebbles ran to them with a big smile. “Did you find treasure?” she asked, her eyes wide with wonder. Fred grinned and said, “Yes, sweetie! Our treasure is our friendship!” Wilma and Betty joined them, smiling proudly. The four friends and Dino laughed together, grateful for their true treasure—each other!",
