  "full_story": "One sunny day, Fred and Barney were having a picnic in the park when they heard the news that the leader of the Boy Scout troop was sick. \"Oh, no! What will the scouts do?\" Fred shouted, his voice booming. \"We can help!\" Barney cheered, his eyes wide with excitement. So, the two friends put on their scout hats and headed to the campsite, with Pebbles and Dino bouncing along beside them. \"Look! A tent!\" Pebbles exclaimed, pointing with glee. Fred and Barney fumbled with the tent, their arms flailing and legs getting tangled, making the scouts giggle. \"It’s just like bowling! I can do this!\" Fred laughed, but he accidentally knocked over the campfire! Wilma and Betty came to the rescue, calming everyone down. \"Let’s keep it safe, Fred!\" Wilma reminded him with a smile. That night, as everyone snuggled in their sleeping bags, dark clouds rolled in, and rain started to pour. \"Oh no! A flood!\" shouted Fred, his heart racing. He quickly gathered the scouts, shouting, \"Follow me to higher ground!\" Pebbles clung to Dino, who barked happily, as they all ran together. The water rose, but Fred stayed brave, encouraging everyone with his loud voice. Finally, they reached a safe spot, and the rain stopped. \"You did it, Fred!\" Barney cheered, and the scouts clapped. The next day, the sun shone bright again, and the scouts thanked Fred for being their hero. \"You’re the best scout leader ever!\" they cried, and Fred felt proud. Wilma hugged him, saying, \"You always take care of your family, and now you took care of the scouts too!\" With Dino wagging his tail and Pebbles giggling, Fred realized that with friends and family by his side, he could take on anything!",
