  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was having a blast playing with his energetic daughter, Pebbles. They were giggling and tossing a bright red ball back and forth when Arnold, the cheeky paperboy, rode by on his bicycle. “Hey, Fred! I can’t wait until you and Pebbles get married when she grows up!” he joked, making Fred’s eyes widen in surprise. “What?!” Fred exclaimed, scratching his head, but Pebbles just laughed, thinking it was silly. That night, Fred snuggled in bed, but he couldn’t shake off Arnold’s words. Suddenly, he fell into a deep sleep and found himself in a strange dream! \n\nIn his dream, Fred was now a grumpy old man of sixty, with a bald head and a very big belly! He looked around and saw Arnold, now a local hero, wearing a shiny badge and taking over Fred’s job at the quarry! “No way!” Fred shouted, clutching his bowling ball. “That’s my job!” But Arnold just waved and said, “Thanks, Fred! I’m your boss now!” Fred felt his heart sink as he watched Arnold win bowling trophies and even lead the Water Buffalo Lodge! \n\nThen Fred spotted Pebbles—now a teenager—running off to get married to Arnold! “Pebbles, no!” he cried, but Pebbles just giggled, “Don’t worry, Daddy! It’s just for fun!” Fred felt dizzy and bumped his head against the wall, waking up with a start! “Phew, what a dream!” he said, wiping his brow. \n\nThe next day, Fred rushed to the Rubbles’ house to share his crazy dream with Barney and Betty. “You won’t believe it!” Fred exclaimed. Barney laughed, “That sounds wild, Fred!” Betty smiled, “You know what? You should tell Pebbles how much you love her today!” Fred nodded, excited to make sure Pebbles knew she was his little girl forever. \n\nWith a big grin, Fred grabbed his bowling ball and called for Pebbles. “Let’s go bowling, Pebbles! Just you and me!” They spent the day bowling and laughing, while Dino wagged his tail happily by their side. Fred felt grateful for his family and friends, realizing that no matter what happened in the future, he would always be Pebbles’ dad. And as they played, Fred knew that friendship and family were the greatest prizes of all!",
