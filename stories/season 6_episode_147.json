  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Wilma and Betty were sitting at the kitchen table, dreaming about a fancy dinner out. “Oh, wouldn’t it be lovely to eat at the Big Rock Restaurant?” said Wilma, her eyes sparkling. “Yes!” replied Betty, smiling. “But it’s so expensive!” Fred, overhearing them, jumped in with his loud voice. “Don’t worry, we can’t afford it anyway!” Barney nodded, “Yeah, we’re just two regular guys!” Suddenly, a bright flash lit up the sky, and a funny little space alien named Gazoo crash-landed right in their backyard! “Hi there, Earthlings!” he chirped, floating in the air. “I can help you!” Fred’s face lit up with excitement. “You mean you can give us money for dinner?” he asked, bouncing on his toes. “Absolutely!” said Gazoo, winking. Fred and Barney cheered and ran inside to tell their wives. “We’re going out for dinner!” they shouted. The ladies giggled with delight as they got ready. But when the bill arrived at the restaurant, Gazoo was nowhere to be found! “Oh no!” Fred exclaimed, looking around. “What will we do?” Barney scratched his head, “We might have to wash the dishes!” The two friends sighed but then laughed. “Well, at least we had fun!” said Fred, and they all joined in, scrubbing the plates together. Wilma and Betty smiled, knowing that being together was the best part of the night, even if they didn’t get to eat fancy food. And as they washed the dishes, Dino wagged his tail, happy to see everyone laughing and working together.",
