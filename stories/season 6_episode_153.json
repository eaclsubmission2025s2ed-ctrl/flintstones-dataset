That sounds fun!” So, with Fred cheering him on and Wilma gently reminding him to be careful, Barney wore a shiny crown made of leaves and a cape made of soft fur. Pebbles giggled, “Look at Daddy’s friend! He’s a king!” Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, thinking it was all a game. The royal tribe showed Barney how to wave and smile like a king, and he tried to be as regal as he could. “All hail King Barney!” the tribe cheered. Barney puffed out his chest proudly, “Thank you, my loyal subjects!” However, when it was time for lunch, Barney realized he missed his friends. “I want to eat with Fred and Wilma!” he declared. The tribe smiled and said, “A good king always shares!” So they all sat together, enjoying a big feast of yummy dino burgers and berry juice. Betty laughed, “Barney, you’re a great king, but an even better friend!” When the sun began to set, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm sang a sweet song called \"Open Up Your Heart,\" making everyone smile. As the day ended, Barney said, “I loved being a king, but I love my friends and family even more!” And they all cheered together, happy to be with each other.",
