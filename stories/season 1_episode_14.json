  "full_story": "In the cozy town of Bedrock, the sun was setting, and a little worry was in the air. “Beep! Beep!” went the news on the radio about a prowler sneaking around! Betty, with her bright smile, said to Barney, “I’m going to take judo lessons to protect myself!” Barney cheered, “That’s a great idea, Betty!” Meanwhile, Wilma, who was calmly sipping tea, said, “I’d like to join you, too!” But Fred, with his loud voice and big laugh, said, “Oh, Wilma! Just one peek at a prowler would make you run faster than a bowling ball!” He chuckled, imagining her surprise. Determined to prove him wrong, Wilma said, “I’ll show you!” That night, Fred thought it would be funny to sneak into the Rubble household dressed as a prowler. “I’ll scare Wilma!” he giggled, tiptoeing around with a silly mask. But just then, the real prowler crept into the neighborhood! Pebbles, with her big curious eyes, spotted the prowler and squealed, “Mommy! Daddy!” Wilma, feeling brave, remembered her judo lessons and said, “I can do this!” She ran outside, and with a swift move, she pretended to kick the air and said loudly, “Go away, you silly prowler!” The real prowler got such a fright from Wilma's fierce voice that he ran away! Fred, still in his silly mask, jumped out and yelled, “Surprise!” But when he saw the real danger was gone, he smiled and said, “You did it, Wilma!” Everyone cheered, and Pebbles giggled, “Mommy is a judo master!” Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, as Betty hugged Wilma, saying, “You were so brave!” Fred, now proud of Wilma, said, “Maybe judo isn’t such a silly idea after all!” And as the stars twinkled above, Bedrock felt safe again, all thanks to teamwork, friendship, and a little bit of courage!",
