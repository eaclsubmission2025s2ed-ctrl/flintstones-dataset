In a flash, Fred grabbed the ball to take a closer look, and before they knew it, “SQUISH!” Fred and Barney were stuck together, their hands glued to the bowling ball! “Uh-oh!” cried Fred, eyes wide with surprise, while Barney giggled, “This is going to be a sticky situation!” Just then, Pebbles peeked in, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. “Daddy! What happened?” she asked, bouncing on her toes. “We’re just having a little… mix-up!” Fred chuckled, trying to wiggle free. Wilma, hearing the commotion, walked in with a calm smile. “Oh, Fred! You’ve done it again!” she said, shaking her head gently. “Let’s get you two unstuck.” As she carefully got some warm water, Dino bounded in, wagging his tail, “Ruff! Ruff!” Fred and Barney laughed, “Good boy, Dino! Can you help us?” With a few splashes and a lot of teamwork, Wilma, Pebbles, and even Dino worked together, and soon, Fred and Barney were free! They all cheered and celebrated with a refreshing glass of grape juice. “Next time, let’s just bowl!” Barney said with a big grin, and Fred, still laughing, agreed, “That sounds like a plan!” And so, they enjoyed their drinks, surrounded by family and friends, knowing that together, they could solve any sticky situation!",
