Wilma and Betty, curious about what their husbands did at those meetings, decided to sneak in and find out. \"Let’s disguise ourselves as men!\" Wilma suggested, grinning at Betty. They put on silly mustaches and big hats, giggling at how funny they looked. \n\nAs they tiptoed to the lodge, Pebbles and Dino watched from the window. Pebbles clapped her hands, \"Look, Mommy and Aunt Betty are being silly!\" Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, eager to join the fun. Inside the lodge, Fred was telling a funny bowling story. \"And then I knocked down all the pins!\" he boomed, making Barney laugh so hard he almost fell off his chair.\n\nJust then, Wilma and Betty peeked through the door. “What if they find us?” whispered Betty, her eyes wide with excitement. “Shh! We’re just here to listen!” Wilma replied, trying to hold back her giggles. They snuck in, but Fred looked right at them. \"Hey! Who are those new guys?\" he exclaimed, his eyes squinting in confusion. \n\nWilma and Betty couldn’t hold it in any longer. They burst out laughing and took off their disguises! \"Surprise!\" they shouted, and everyone in the lodge erupted in laughter. Fred’s laughter was the loudest. \"You two are the best at sneaking!\" he said, giving Wilma a big hug. Barney added, “Now you can join the fun!” \n\nThat night, they all went home together, with Pebbles skipping alongside Dino, who playfully chased a butterfly. \"Mommy, can we go to the lodge again?\" Pebbles asked, her eyes sparkling. “Of course, sweetheart!” Wilma replied, smiling at her family. And with Fred and Barney planning their next silly adventure, the laughter of friendship filled the air, making it a perfect day for everyone!",
