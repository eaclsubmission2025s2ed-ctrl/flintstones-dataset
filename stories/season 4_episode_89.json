Meanwhile, Wilma was busy making lunch, shaking her head with a smile. “Just remember, Fred, don’t be too loud or impulsive!” she cautioned. Pebbles peeked around the corner, her big eyes wide with curiosity. “Who’s Ann-Margrock, Daddy?” she asked. Fred scratched his head. “I don’t know, but she must be super famous!” \n\nThat evening, Ann-Margrock arrived, and Fred and Barney were bubbling with excitement. “Let’s show her how great Bedrock is!” Fred yelled. But when they met her, Fred accidentally tripped over Dino, who was wagging his tail happily. “Oops! Sorry, Dino!” Fred laughed, while Dino barked like a dog, excited to meet their guest. Ann-Margrock giggled. “No worries! I love playful pets!” she said, her smile brightening the room. \n\nAfter a few funny attempts to impress her, Fred and Barney finally got picked to be on Ann-Margrock’s show at the new Hollyrock Bowl. “This is going to be epic!” Fred cheered, while Wilma and Betty clapped their hands, bursting with pride. “You two will do great!” Wilma said, giving Fred a supportive hug. \n\nOn the big day, Pebbles cheered loudly, “Go, Daddy! Go, Barney!” as they took the stage. Fred and Barney danced and sang with all their might, making everyone laugh and smile. Even Mr. Slate, who usually looked stern, cracked a smile and tapped his foot to the beat. After the show, Ann-Margrock gave them a big thumbs up. “You two were fantastic!” she declared, making Fred and Barney beam with happiness. \n\nAs the sun set, Fred hugged his family tight. “What an amazing day! Friends, family, and fun!” he exclaimed, and everyone agreed, their hearts full of joy.",
