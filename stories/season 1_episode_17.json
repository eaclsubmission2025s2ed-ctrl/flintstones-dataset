  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred and Barney were walking to the quarry when they stumbled upon a shiny, blue bag lying on the ground. \"Look, Barney! It’s a treasure!\" Fred shouted, his eyes sparkling with excitement. They opened the bag and gasped—$86,000! “Wow, that’s a lot of money!” laughed Barney, scratching his head. \"We should return it to the bank!\" Fred declared, but as they hurried to the bank, they were mistaken for bank robbers by the security guards! “Run, Barney!” Fred yelled, and they both dashed away, giggling and panting.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilma and Betty were at home, sipping lemonade. “We need to help Fred and Barney!” Wilma said, her mind racing. “Let’s lure the real crooks to our house!” Betty nodded, her eyes twinkling with mischief. They set up a clever trap with a big sign that said, “FREE MONEY HERE!” Just then, Fred and Barney returned, thinking they could sneak back in to grab the money. “This is going to be great!” Fred beamed, but oh no! The real crooks saw them and quickly captured Betty and Wilma, leaving Fred and Barney shocked. \n\n“Uh-oh! What do we do now?” Barney whimpered, looking worried. Just then, Dino, their silly pet dinosaur, came bounding in, barking happily, and distracted the crooks! “Go, Dino!” Fred cheered, and with a brave heart, he accidentally bumped into the crooks, tumbling them into a pile of pillows. “We got them!” Fred exclaimed, puffing out his chest. \n\nLater, when the police arrived, they were so grateful to Fred and Barney for catching the crooks, but Fred couldn’t help but exaggerate, “I did it all by myself!” Wilma and Betty shared a knowing smile. They had a secret plan! With the reward money, they bought all the things they wanted—a shiny new car for Fred, a beautiful dress for Wilma, and even a giant bone for Dino! “Wait, what about me?” Fred cried when he saw the bill. Everyone burst into laughter, and Fred, with a playful frown, knew he would always have fun adventures with his family and friends. And that made him smile, too!",
