  "full_story": "Once upon a time in the colorful town of Bedrock, Fred was bursting with excitement! “Wilma, let’s go on a second honeymoon!” he shouted, waving his arms as he bounced around the living room. Wilma smiled, but she crossed her arms, looking a bit unsure. “Really, Fred? You’ve been a little too loud and impulsive lately,” she said calmly. Fred scratched his head, realizing he may have been a bit silly. But he wanted to make things right! So, off they went to a sparkling waterfall, hand in hand. Just then, Barney and Betty peeked over the fence. “Where are you two going?” Barney cheered, his eyes wide with curiosity. “To a second honeymoon!” shouted Fred, grinning. “Can we come?” asked Pebbles, bouncing up and down. “Not this time, Pebbles, but we’ll bring you back a surprise!” promised Wilma. \n\nAt the waterfall, Fred tried to impress Wilma by bowling rocks into the water. “Look at me!” he boomed, but he accidentally splashed water all over her! Wilma giggled, but then she playfully turned away. “Maybe I’ll just sit this one out,” she teased, pretending to be hard to get. Fred frowned, realizing he needed to be more thoughtful. “I’m sorry, Wilma. I’ll be more careful!” he said, trying to be serious. Just then, Mr. Slate showed up, looking flustered. “Fred! I have some news. The judge who married you two was unlicensed!” he huffed, adjusting his glasses. “What?!” gasped Wilma, her eyes wide. \n\nFred laughed nervously. “Does that mean we’re not really married?” he asked, scratching his head again. But Wilma smiled brightly, “Oh, Fred, we’re still a family, and that’s what matters!” Fred’s heart swelled with joy. He hugged her tightly, and Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, rushed over with a joyful bark, wagging his tail like a big puppy. “Let’s celebrate our love with a big family picnic!” suggested Betty, and everyone cheered! They spread out a colorful blanket under the blue sky and shared sandwiches and laughter. Fred promised to listen more, and Wilma promised to let him be silly sometimes. With Pebbles giggling and Barney and Betty joining in, they all agreed that family and love were what really made them happy. And with Dino playfully chasing butterflies, they knew every day could be an adventure together!",
