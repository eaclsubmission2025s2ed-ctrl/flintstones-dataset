I won a flying lesson at the lodge contest!” Pebbles jumped with joy, her eyes sparkling, “Wow, Daddy! Can I come watch?” Wilma smiled calmly, “Of course, but be careful, Fred!” Fred grinned, “I’ll be the best flyer ever!” At the lodge, Fred met his flying teacher, a cheerful young woman named Miss Sky. She had bright eyes and a big smile. “Are you ready to fly, Fred?” she asked. “Ready as a bird!” he shouted, waving his arms. Barney and Betty arrived, cheering, “You can do it, Fred!” Pebbles giggled and clapped. As Fred soared into the sky, he felt like a superhero, yelling, “Look at me!” But suddenly, he felt a little scared. \"What if I fall?\" he thought.

When he landed, everyone cheered, and Fred said, “Flying is super fun! Thanks, Miss Sky!” Wilma hugged him tightly, saying, “We’re proud of you, dear.” Pebbles squealed, “Can we fly again, Daddy?” Fred smiled, “Next time, I’ll take all of you!” And they all laughed, dreaming of their next adventure together.",
