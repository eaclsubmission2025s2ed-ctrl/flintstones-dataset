Let’s take our wives to the amusement park for some fun!” Wilma rolled her eyes but smiled, while Betty nodded happily. “But you two never take us anywhere nice!” Wilma pointed out, crossing her arms. Fred puffed out his chest, “We will today!” After a little argument, the families piled into the car, but oh no! Fred forgot his favorite record! Meanwhile, a group of teenagers found it and heard Fred’s amazing singing voice. “Wow! He’s awesome!” they cheered. Soon, everyone called him “Hi-Fye,” and Fred became a star, wearing shiny clothes and singing everywhere! But as the days passed, Fred became a bit too proud, strutting around and forgetting his family. Wilma and Betty missed their cozy home. “What if we spread a silly rumor about him?” Betty suggested with a mischievous grin. “That’ll bring him back to us!” They giggled and whispered about “Hi-Fye” being scared of dinosaurs! As the rumor spread, people stopped cheering for Fred, and he felt sad and lonely. When he saw Wilma and Betty looking worried, he realized how much he missed them. “I’m sorry for forgetting you!” he said, his voice soft. “I just wanted to be special.” Wilma hugged him tight, “You are special to us, Fred!” With a big smile, Fred promised to always make time for family fun. And from that day on, they went on adventures together, laughing and loving each other, with Dino wagging his tail happily beside them!",
