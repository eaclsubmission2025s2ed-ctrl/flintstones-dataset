  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred burst into the house, waving a shiny sweepstakes ticket. “Look, Wilma! I bought a ticket! I’m going to win big!” he shouted, his loud voice echoing. Wilma smiled softly, “That’s wonderful, Fred, but let’s not get too carried away.” Meanwhile, next door, Barney was bouncing up and down, “Can I join you, Fred? Please?” Fred nodded excitedly, “Of course! We’ll share it!” Just then, Wilma and Betty were whispering, “Let’s buy our own tickets, Betty. But shh! We don’t want Fred and Barney to know!” They giggled as they tucked the tickets away.\n\nDays passed, and Fred decided to hide his ticket in a coat. But, oh no! Betty, thinking it was a donation, gave the coat to a friendly hobo! “Where’s our ticket, Barney?” Fred cried, his eyes wide with worry. “I… I don’t know!” Barney replied, scratching his head. Fred frowned, feeling frustrated. “I’ll sneak into your house and get it back!” he said, tiptoeing over to Barney’s home. But instead of his ticket, he accidentally grabbed the girls’ ticket!\n\nLater, at home, Wilma and Betty jumped up and down with joy. “We won the sweepstakes!” they cheered, their faces beaming with happiness. Fred and Barney, hiding behind the couch, groaned. “Now they’ll buy all the fun things!” Fred grumbled. “We need to get to the store first!” They hatched a silly plan and raced to grab their favorite toys before their wives could spend their winnings.\n\nIn the end, as Fred and Barney giggled with their new toys, Wilma and Betty walked in, arms crossed but smiling. “Looks like someone didn’t think this through!” Betty teased. Fred and Barney laughed, realizing that sharing and teamwork were way more fun than sneaky plans. And with hearts full of joy, they all spent the day together, playing and laughing until the stars twinkled in the sky.",
