I’m ready to roll!” she giggled, bouncing with energy. Just then, Barney came running over, his big smile shining brighter than the sun. “Fred! I need your help! I want to surprise Betty with a special engagement ring, but I can’t keep it safe!” he exclaimed, handing Fred a sparkling box. “Sure, buddy!” Fred said, placing the box in his pocket, but when Wilma walked by, her eyes lit up with joy. “Oh, Fred! Is that for me?” she asked, her heart fluttering. Fred, not wanting to spoil her dreams, nodded, “Of course, dear!” That night, Fred whispered to Barney, “We need to get another ring!” But oh no! They needed money! So, Fred hatched a wild plan. “Barney, let’s fight the boxing champ! We could win $500!” Barney’s eyes widened, “Really? That sounds fun!” \n\nThe next day, Wilma and Betty, overhearing the plan, exchanged worried glances. “We can’t let Barney get hurt!” said Wilma, her brow furrowed. “Let’s talk to the champion!” They hurried to the boxing ring, where the big champ flexed his muscles. “You won’t hurt my Barney!” Betty declared bravely. The champion chuckled, “Alright, let’s make it a fair fight.” But when the match began, the champ knocked Barney down with a big punch! Wilma and Betty gasped, their hearts racing. “Not on our watch!” they shouted, rushing into the ring! With fierce determination, they talked the champ’s manager into giving Barney the prize money. “He deserves it!” they insisted. \n\nAfter the fuss, Barney, still a bit wobbly, finally bought the ring for Betty, and when she saw it, her eyes sparkled brighter than the diamonds! “Oh, Barney! It’s perfect!” she squealed, hugging him tight. Fred and Wilma shared a proud smile, knowing that friendship and love always win in the end.
