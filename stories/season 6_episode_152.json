I’d rather bowl!\" But Wilma gently reminded him, \"It’ll be fun, and everyone will cheer you on!\" Just then, Barney peeked through the window, his cheerful voice ringing out, \"Did someone say dance? I’ll help you, Fred!\" Pebbles jumped up and down, her little hands clapping, \"Yay! Dancing is fun!\" \n\nAt the contest, the bright lights sparkled, and the music played loudly. Jimmy O'Neillstone, the friendly host, welcomed everyone. \"Let’s see some great moves!\" he said with a grin. Fred felt nervous, but with Wilma by his side, he took a deep breath. \"You can do it, Fred!\" she encouraged. As he stepped onto the stage, Dino wagged his tail excitedly from the audience, barking happily, \"Ruff! Ruff!\"\n\nThe music started, and Fred tried to dance, but his clumsy moves turned into funny slips and trips! Each time he stumbled, the crowd roared with laughter, and Barney shouted, \"That’s a new dance move!\" Even Betty joined in, clapping and cheering, \"Go, Fred! You look great!\" Fred couldn’t help but laugh at himself. He twirled and spun, his feet moving in silly ways, and soon everyone was dancing along, even Mr. Slate, who had come to see his employee!\n\nAs the Beau Brummelstones sang \"Laugh, Laugh,\" Fred found himself having the best time ever. He twirled Pebbles around, and Dino bounced beside them, barking in joy. Finally, when the music ended, the audience erupted in cheers! Fred smiled wide, feeling proud. \"I didn’t win, but I had so much fun!\" he exclaimed. Wilma hugged him tightly, \"We all did, Fred! You were amazing!\" Fred looked around at his family and friends, realizing that the best part was dancing together. And with Dino by his side, he knew every day could be a dance party!",
