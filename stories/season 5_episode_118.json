He had planned a big party with cake and balloons, and he couldn’t wait to celebrate with friends and family. Meanwhile, Wilma smiled and said, \"Let’s make it special, Fred!\" They decorated their home with colorful streamers, while Pebbles giggled, reaching for the shiny balloons. \n\nAt the same time, Barney and Betty were getting ready for the Water Buffalo Lodge party. \"We’ll be the best party helpers ever!\" Barney cheered, his eyes sparkling with joy. \"Right, Betty?\" Betty chuckled, \"Absolutely! But let’s make sure everything goes smoothly.\"\n\nBut oh no! The only caterer in town mixed up the two parties! Instead of delivering delicious cake and snacks for Pebbles, he sent a silly clown to the Water Buffalo Lodge. \"What’s happening here?\" Mr. Slate grumbled as the clown honked his nose and made everyone laugh. \"This is a serious party!\" \n\nAt Pebbles' party, instead of the clown, dancing girls twirled around, making Pebbles giggle even more. \"This is not what I ordered!\" Fred exclaimed, scratching his head. Dino barked happily, thinking the dancing girls were the best surprise ever! \n\nWilma took a deep breath and said, \"Let’s turn this around, Fred. We can have fun no matter what!\" Fred nodded, his frown turning into a smile. \"You’re right, Wilma! Let’s make it a party to remember!\" \n\nBarney, who was still at the lodge, heard Fred’s excitement and rushed over. \"What can I do to help?\" he asked. \"We need games!\" shouted Pebbles, clapping her tiny hands. So, Fred, Wilma, and Barney set up fun games, and soon everyone was laughing and playing together. \n\nAs the sun began to set, Fred looked around at the happy faces of friends and family. \"This is the best birthday ever, Pebbles!\" he said, lifting her into the air. Pebbles giggled, reaching for the stars. \n\nAnd just then, Baby Puss, the tiny kitten, peeked around the corner, meowing softly. \"Oh, look!\" Wilma said with a smile. \"Even Baby Puss wants to join the fun!\" \n\nThat night, as they all enjoyed cake and laughter, Fred learned that with family and friends, every moment could be a wonderful adventure, even if things didn’t go as planned. And Pebbles? She had the happiest first birthday ever!",
