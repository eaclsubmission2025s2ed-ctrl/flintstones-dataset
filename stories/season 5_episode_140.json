  "full_story": "One sunny day, Fred and Wilma decided to take Pebbles to Rock Island Beach for a big surfing contest. “I can’t wait to show off my surfing skills!” Fred shouted, his voice booming with excitement. But, uh-oh! Fred couldn’t actually surf! Wilma smiled calmly and said, “Don’t worry, Fred. We’ll have fun together!” Their cheerful neighbors, Barney and Betty, joined them. “Can we surf too?” Barney asked, his eyes sparkling with joy. “Of course!” replied Betty, always supportive. When they arrived at the beach, Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, “Arf! Arf!” as he splashed in the waves. Pebbles giggled and clapped her hands, “Look, Daddy! The water is so big!” Fred’s eyes grew wide, but he was determined. With a big, goofy grin, he said, “Let’s do it!” The contest began, and singer Jimmy Darrock cheered them on with a smile. Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty all took turns on their surfboards, splashing and tumbling in the water, while Pebbles cheered, “Go, Mommy! Go, Daddy!” Fred crashed into the waves, but he laughed and said, “That was a wipeout!” Everyone giggled, and even Dino tried to surf, wobbling on a small board. At the end of the day, though they didn’t win, they all hugged and jumped with joy on the beach! “The best part was being together!” Fred said, and everyone nodded happily, knowing that family fun was the real prize.",
