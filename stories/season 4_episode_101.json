I need a break from housework!” Pebbles giggled as she played with her toys, while Wilma calmly replied, “How about helping out a little, Fred?” Just then, Barney popped his head through the door, a big smile on his face. “Hey, Fred! I found a super fun club for dads!” Fred's eyes sparkled with excitement. “What’s the catch, Barney?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. “We just drop off Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm at the parking lot and play cards!” Barney explained, bouncing on his toes. “It’ll be a blast!” So, the two friends hurried to the club, where Dino wagged his tail, excited to see Fred. “Roar! Dino wants to play too!” he barked happily. Fred laughed and said, “You can’t come to the card game, buddy, but you can watch Pebbles!” As they settled into their chairs, Fred and Barney shuffled the cards. “This is the best idea ever!” Fred shouted, grinning widely. Meanwhile, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm waved and giggled from the parking lot, their little feet dancing. Just then, Mr. Slate walked by, looking stern. “Fred! What are you doing?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. Fred gulped but replied cheerfully, “Just a little fatherly fun, Mr. Slate!” Mr. Slate chuckled, shaking his head. “Just be sure to help out when you get home!” After a fun-filled day of laughter and games, Fred and Barney returned home, arms full of giggling children. “Okay, Wilma, we’ll help with housework now!” Fred said with a big smile. Wilma nodded, proud of her husband as they all joined in to tidy up, making it a fun family affair!",
