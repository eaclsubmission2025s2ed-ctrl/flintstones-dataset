  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was rushing to get ready for bowling when—oops!—he accidentally dropped a bottle of shiny car polish right on his head! “Ouch!” he exclaimed, shaking his head. But when he stood up, something strange happened. “Hello, my dear Wilma,” he said in a fancy voice. “I shall now be known as Frederick!” Wilma raised her eyebrows in surprise. “Well, this is different!” she replied, smiling. \n\nFred, now Frederick, was polite and charming. He opened doors for everyone and even said “please” and “thank you” at the bowling alley. Barney, Fred's cheerful neighbor, scratched his head. “This is fun, but where’s my buddy Fred?” he wondered aloud. Betty, Barney’s kind wife, giggled. “I think we need to talk to Wilma!” \n\nAs days went by, Wilma loved Frederick’s manners at first, but soon she felt overwhelmed. “Can a man be too nice?” she wondered, breaking the fourth wall as she looked right at the readers! Meanwhile, Barney’s friends heard about Frederick and their wives wanted them to be just like him. “Oh no!” Barney said, looking worried. “What if we can’t be as nice?” \n\nDetermined to bring back the old Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty hatched a plan. They found a big rock and whispered, “When we hit him on the head, he’ll be Fred again!” With a gentle whack, they tapped Frederick’s head and—POOF! He blinked and shouted, “Yabba Dabba Doo! I’m back!” \n\nEveryone cheered, and Wilma laughed with relief. “Welcome back, Fred!” she said, giving him a big hug. Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, jumped around happily, wagging his tail. “Let’s go bowling!” Fred shouted, and they all ran outside, ready for a fun-filled day together, celebrating the joy of being themselves and the love of family and friends.",
