Inside was a love poem addressed to Wilma, written by someone else! “Who could it be?” Fred shouted, his voice booming like thunder. His heart raced with jealousy, and he immediately decided to hire Bedrock’s top detective, Perry Gunnite, to solve the mystery. “I’ll find out who this sneaky poet is!” he declared, puffing out his chest. \n\nMeanwhile, Wilma was busy baking cookies with Pebbles, who was bouncing around, full of energy. “Look, Mommy! I can help!” Pebbles chirped, trying to sift flour but making a tiny mess instead. Just then, Barney popped over, his cheerful smile lighting up the day. “What’s wrong, Fred?” he asked, noticing Fred’s frown. “I think it’s you, Barney!” Fred yelled, pointing a finger dramatically. “The poem is from you!” \n\nBarney scratched his head, looking confused. “But I didn’t write it!” he replied, his voice light and innocent. Fred's heart raced with anger, but just then, Wilma walked in with a tray of warm cookies, smiling gently. “Fred, sweetie, remember when you wrote me a love poem long ago?” she asked, her eyes sparkling. Fred’s face turned red as he realized the truth. “Oh no! That poem was from me!” he exclaimed, feeling a mix of embarrassment and relief. \n\nWith a big grin, Fred hugged Wilma tightly. “I’m sorry for being silly, Barney!” he shouted, running over to his friend. “You’re still my best buddy!” Barney beamed and gave Fred a big bear hug. “And I’ll help you write a new poem for Wilma!” Pebbles squealed with joy, “Let’s make it the best poem ever!” The friends laughed together, and Dino wagged his tail, joining in on the fun. That day, Fred learned that love is about kindness and friendship, and he couldn’t wait to share his new poem with Wilma.",
