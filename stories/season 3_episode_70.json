You’ll be a star!” Fred’s wife, Wilma, smiled calmly. “Just remember to be careful, dear,” she said, adjusting Pebbles' little sun hat. Pebbles giggled, “Daddy, are you going to be a spy?” \n\nWhen they arrived in Hawaii, Fred met the famous Larry Lava, who grinned and said, “You’ll be my stunt double! Let’s have some fun!” Fred’s eyes sparkled with excitement, but as the cameras rolled, it was Wilma who stole the show! With her clever ideas, she helped everyone, turning each scene into a big adventure. “Go, Wilma!” Pebbles cheered, clapping her tiny hands. Dino wagged his tail, barking happily as Wilma twirled like a star.\n\nWhen the filming was done, Larry Lava said, “You’re a real star, Wilma!” Fred laughed and hugged her. “I’m so proud of you!” he exclaimed. Wilma smiled brightly, “Thanks, Fred! But you’ll always be my number one.” Barney and Betty cheered, “Hooray for Wilma!” As they all danced on the sandy beach, Pebbles squealed, “Family fun is the best!” Dino jumped around, and everyone knew that whether in Hawaii or at home, they were a team full of joy and love.",
