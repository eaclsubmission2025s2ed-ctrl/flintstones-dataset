He invited Barney and Betty over to watch the videos. \"This is the best one!\" Fred exclaimed, pressing play as Pebbles spun in circles, laughing. Barney chuckled, \"She’s so funny!\" But soon, Fred became so obsessed with filming, he forgot to help Wilma with dinner and even missed going bowling with Barney! Wilma looked worried. \"Fred, it's important to spend time with family too,\" she said gently. Pebbles tugged at his shirt, \"Daddy, play with me!\" Fred realized he was missing out on fun. \"You're right!\" he said, putting down the camera. That evening, the family played games together while Dino wagged his tail happily. \"No more movies for now!\" Fred laughed, hugging Pebbles. \"Family time is the best kind of fun!\" And with that, they all shared giggles and smiles, knowing that memories made together were the best movies of all.",
