  "full_story": "On a sunny Saturday morning in Bedrock, Fred Flintstone was bouncing with excitement. “I can’t wait for golf today!” he shouted, his loud voice echoing through the neighborhood. But when he learned that the golf game was canceled, he stomped his feet in frustration. “Barney, you’re stupid for not checking the schedule!” he yelled at his best friend, who looked hurt and confused. “But, Fred, I didn’t mean to!” Barney replied, his cheerful face now drooping. Fred didn’t apologize, and instead, Barney decided to do something drastic. “I’m putting my house up for sale!” he declared, surprising everyone around. Betty, his kind wife, rushed over. “Oh no, Barney! Don’t do that!” she said, her eyes wide with worry. Meanwhile, Pebbles peeked out from behind her mom, her little hands on her hips. “That’s silly, Daddy! You love our home!” she chimed in, trying to cheer up her friend. Just then, Dino, the playful pet dinosaur, wagged his tail and barked, hoping to lighten the mood. But things got even more exciting when Yippy Ye O'Rock, a rich Texan with a big, shiny hat, showed up, eager to buy Barney’s house. “I’ll give you a mountain of money for it!” he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. Fred saw Barney looking sad and realized he missed their fun adventures together. “I’m sorry, Barney,” Fred finally said, scratching his head. “I shouldn’t have called you stupid. Can we be friends again?” Barney smiled, his face lighting up. “Of course, Fred! Let’s go bowling instead!” With Pebbles cheering and Dino jumping around, Fred and Barney hugged, and soon they were off to the bowling alley, leaving the sale behind. And as they laughed and played, the friends knew that nothing was more important than their friendship!",
