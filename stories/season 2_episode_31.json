I want a new adventure!” His wife Wilma, calmly sipping her tea, raised an eyebrow and said, “But Fred, you love bowling and your job!” Fred, with a big grin, replied, “I’ll be a school bus driver instead—how fun!” Wilma sighed but smiled, “Alright, just make sure it’s safe!” Fred dashed out the door, and his cheerful neighbor Barney bounced over, “What’s up, Fred?” “I’m driving a school bus!” Fred exclaimed, his voice booming. “Can I come?” asked Barney, his eyes sparkling. “Sure! Let’s go!” Pebbles jumped up and down, “I want to ride too!” “You can, Pebbles! Just be good!” Fred winked. \n\nAt the school, Fred met Mr. Granite, his new boss, who looked very stern but said, “Make sure the kids are safe, Fred.” “You bet!” Fred replied confidently. As the bus rumbled along the bumpy road, Pebbles giggled, “This is the best ride ever!” Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, ran alongside the bus, barking happily. Fred chuckled, “Look, Dino wants to join us!” \n\nThe kids laughed as they sang silly songs, and Barney was so busy singing he almost forgot to help Fred steer! “Watch out for that rock!” Pebbles shouted, and Fred swerved just in time, “Phew! Thanks, Pebbles!” By the time they reached Red Rock, Fred felt proud. “Best day ever!” he cheered. Wilma and Betty waved from the schoolyard, smiling brightly. “You did it, Fred!” Wilma called. Fred grinned, “I might just keep this job!” And with everyone happy and cheering, Fred knew he had found a new adventure, surrounded by family and friends.",
