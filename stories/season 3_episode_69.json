Wilma!\" he shouted, his loud voice echoing off the walls. \"Uncle Tex is coming to visit, and I told him we had a baby boy named Tex Jr.!\" Wilma, calm and smart, put her hands on her hips and said, \"Fred, we can't just pretend! We don’t have a baby boy!\" Just then, Pebbles bounced in, her pigtails swaying. \"Daddy, can I help?\" she chirped, full of energy. \"Yes! We need to find a way to make Uncle Tex believe!\" Fred said with a big grin. Barney and Betty popped in next door, curious about the commotion. \"What’s happening?\" asked cheerful Barney. Fred explained the plan, and Barney's eyes sparkled. \"Let’s make it a surprise party for Uncle Tex!\" he exclaimed. Betty nodded, \"And we can decorate and bake a cake!\" Meanwhile, Dino waddled in, wagging his tail, barking happily. “Dino, you can be our special helper!” said Pebbles, giggling. \n\nAs everyone worked together, they decorated the house with colorful balloons and streamers, while Betty baked a giant cake shaped like a baby bottle. When Uncle Tex arrived, Fred tried to act super cool. “Welcome, Uncle Tex! Meet our baby boy, Tex Jr.!” he said, trying to keep a straight face. Wilma held a stuffed toy, pretending it was the baby. Uncle Tex squinted suspiciously but smiled, “What a fine little fellow!” Just then, Pebbles jumped up, holding a sign that said, “Surprise!” Everyone shouted, “Surprise!” and Uncle Tex burst into laughter. “What a clever family you have, Fred!” he chuckled. Dino barked and jumped, making everyone giggle even more. They all enjoyed the cake, played games, and had a wonderful time together, with Fred realizing that family and friends are the best treasure of all.",
