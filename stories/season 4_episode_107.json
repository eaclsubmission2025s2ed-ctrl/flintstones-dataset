  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred was excited to go on a fishing trip with Barney. “Let’s catch the biggest fish ever!” he shouted, his loud voice echoing. As they fished, Fred saw something furry by the water. “Look, Barney! A cute little kitten!” he exclaimed, scooping it up. He brought the tiny creature home, and Pebbles squealed with joy, “Can we keep it, Daddy?” Wilma raised her eyebrows but smiled. “It’s so adorable!” Soon, the kitten began to grow, and grow, and grow until it turned into a big, fluffy lion! “Oh no!” Fred cried, as the lion roared and chased Dino, who wagged his tail but looked scared. “What if it eats us?” Wilma said calmly, thinking hard. “We need a plan!” Betty, who was visiting, suggested they lure the lion outside with a big, juicy steak. “Great idea!” said Barney, grinning. Fred and Barney worked together to carry the steak while Pebbles giggled, and Dino barked excitedly. When they finally threw the steak outside, the lion dashed after it, allowing Fred to quickly close the door. “Phew! That was close!” Fred sighed, wiping his brow. Wilma smiled, “Next time, let’s stick to catching fish!” Everyone laughed, and they hugged their silly, adventurous family, thankful for each other and ready for the next fun day.",
