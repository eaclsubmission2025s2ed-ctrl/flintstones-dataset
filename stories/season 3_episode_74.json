  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred bounded into the living room, his big feet thumping on the floor. He spotted Wilma, sitting peacefully in her favorite chair, reading a thick book. \"What are you reading, Wilma?\" Fred asked, his voice loud and curious. Wilma smiled and replied, \"Just a mystery novel, Fred. It's about a detective!\" But Fred's mind raced, and he thought, \"What if she’s plotting something mysterious against me?\" He scratched his head, eyes wide. \n\nJust then, Barney popped his head through the door, his cheerful smile shining bright. \"Hey, Fred! Want to go bowling?\" Fred jumped up, eager to forget his worries. \"Sure, but first, I need to figure out this mystery!\" He grabbed Barney's arm and pulled him inside. \"What if Wilma wants to collect life insurance money?\" he whispered dramatically. \n\nBarney giggled, \"That’s silly, Fred! Wilma loves you!\" Meanwhile, Betty, Barney's wife, peeked in with a tray of cookies. \"What’s going on, boys?\" she asked, wiping her hands on her apron. Fred, still worried, explained his wild thoughts. Betty chuckled softly, \"You know Wilma would never do that! She’s too smart and kind!\" \n\nPebbles bounded in, her red hair bouncing. \"Daddy! Let’s play!\" she cheered, and Fred’s heart melted. \"Okay, sweetie! But first, I need to talk to Dino!\" The playful dinosaur came running, wagging his tail like a puppy, and licked Fred’s face. \"See, Fred? Dino loves you too!\" Barney laughed.\n\nFinally, Fred decided to ask Wilma directly. He approached her with a big grin. \"Wilma, are you planning anything sneaky?\" Wilma laughed, shaking her head, \"Of course not! I’m just enjoying my book!\" \n\nFeeling relieved, Fred chuckled and hugged Wilma tightly. \"I guess I was being silly!\" he said, smiling wide. As the sun set over Bedrock, the friends and family gathered for a fun game of bowling, laughter filling the air, and Fred realized that love and friendship were the greatest mysteries of all!",
