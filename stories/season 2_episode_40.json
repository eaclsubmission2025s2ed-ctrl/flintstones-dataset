I bought tickets to the big costume ball from Mr. Slate!” he shouted, his eyes sparkling. Wilma, with her calm smile, replied, “That sounds wonderful, Fred! Let’s pick costumes tonight!” Pebbles jumped up and down, her curly hair bouncing, “I want to be a princess!” “And I’ll be a brave knight!” Fred said, puffing out his chest. That night, they dressed up together. Fred wore a big, silly dinosaur suit, while Wilma was a beautiful queen. Pebbles twirled in her sparkly dress, giggling. At the ball, they danced and laughed, and Barney and Betty joined in, with Barney dressed as a goofy clown and Betty as a fairy. Suddenly, Fred saw someone in a fancy costume and shouted, “Hey! Look at that funny guy!” He ran over, thinking it was just another guest, but it was Mr. Slate! The stern boss looked surprised, and everyone burst into laughter. “Fred, it’s me, your boss!” he said, chuckling. Fred’s face turned bright red, but he laughed too, “Oops! I’m so sorry, Mr. Slate!” Wilma gently took his arm, “Let’s all dance together!” And they did, swirling and twirling under the twinkling lights, making wonderful memories as friends and family.",
