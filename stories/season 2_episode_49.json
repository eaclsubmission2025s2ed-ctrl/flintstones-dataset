But Barney was tired of Fred's pranks! “I’ll show him!” he whispered to his wife, Betty, as he smiled mischievously. That afternoon, Barney decided to pretend he was a counterfeiter in his basement, using the prize money he won in a slogan contest. “I’ll make Fred think I’m in big trouble!” he chuckled. Meanwhile, Wilma and Betty were busy trying to stop their husbands from their silly games. “Fred, you need to be more careful!” Wilma called out while shaking her head. Just then, Fred strolled over to Barney's house, his eyes wide with curiosity. “What’s going on down there? Is Barney in trouble?” he wondered. He peeked through the window and gasped! “Oh no! That money looks fake!” he shouted, imagining Barney in a big jail cell. As Fred burst into the basement, he found Barney laughing with stacks of colorful paper money everywhere. “Surprise, Fred!” Barney yelled, holding up a funny sign that said, “Not Real Money!” Fred laughed and scratched his head, “You got me this time, Barney!” Just then, Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, bounded in, wagging his tail and barking happily. “Dino, you’ll never believe what just happened!” Fred said, as he and Barney shared a big laugh. Wilma and Betty smiled, knowing that friendship and fun were what really mattered, even if it meant a few silly pranks along the way!",
