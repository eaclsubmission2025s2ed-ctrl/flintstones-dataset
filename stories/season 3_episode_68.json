  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was munching on a big bowl of Bronto-berries when he overheard Wilma and Betty chatting in the kitchen. “I can’t wait for our little visitor to arrive!” Wilma said with a smile. Fred’s eyes grew wide with excitement. “A baby! We’re having a baby!” he shouted, bouncing around the room. Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, wagged his tail and barked happily, thinking Fred was just playing a game. Fred rushed to his mother-in-law’s house, saying, “You must come help Wilma with the baby!” With a nod, she quickly packed her things. Meanwhile, Wilma and Betty giggled, not knowing what Fred had imagined. When Fred's mother-in-law arrived, Fred could hardly contain his joy, but moments later, the doorbell rang. Fred opened the door, ready to welcome his new baby, but instead, there stood Arnold, the paperboy, with a big stack of newspapers! “I’m your little visitor!” Arnold grinned, holding up a newspaper. Fred’s mouth dropped open in surprise, and Dino tilted his head, confused. Wilma and Betty burst into laughter, and Fred scratched his head, chuckling too. “Well, Arnold, you’re just the right kind of visitor!” Fred said, giving him a friendly pat on the back. And so, the day turned into a fun adventure with Arnold delivering papers, Pebbles giggling, and everyone enjoying a big family picnic in the sun, reminding them that surprises can be the best kind of fun!",
