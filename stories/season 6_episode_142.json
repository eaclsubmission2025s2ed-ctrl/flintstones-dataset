She wants to see her favorite son-in-law!” Wilma smiled calmly, “That’s wonderful, Fred! But we need to make sure our home is ready.” Fred’s eyes sparkled with excitement, “I know! I’ll fix up that old house in the backyard!” \n\nAs Fred raced outside, Pebbles giggled, bouncing with energy. “Can I help, Daddy?” she asked, grinning. “Of course, sweetie! We’ll make it the best house ever!” They gathered tools, and Fred got to work, hammering and painting, while Pebbles handed him nails and cheered, “Go, Daddy, go!”\n\nBarney peeked over the fence, his cheerful face brightening up. “What’s happening, Fred?” he called. “I’m fixing up a house for my mother-in-law!” Fred replied proudly. “Can I help too?” Barney asked, bouncing with excitement. “Yes, you can be my assistant!” Fred laughed, and together they made quite a silly team, with Barney accidentally painting his own nose bright pink!\n\nMeanwhile, Wilma and Betty were busy preparing snacks. “I hope Fred can finish in time!” Wilma said, rolling her eyes playfully. “He’ll do great,” Betty replied with a smile, imagining the fun they’d all have together.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Dino trotted over, wagging his tail happily. “Ruff!” he barked, ready to help. Fred chuckled, “Even Dino wants to help! Let’s put a little fence around the house, buddy!” With Dino carrying sticks in his mouth, they built a tiny fence that made the house look just right.\n\nFinally, the day of Fred’s mother-in-law’s arrival came. Wilma and Pebbles stood at the door while Fred and Barney proudly showed off the new house. “Surprise!” they shouted as she stepped inside. Her eyes widened with joy. “Oh, Fred, it’s perfect! You’ve really outdone yourself!” she exclaimed, hugging him tightly.\n\nEveryone cheered, and Pebbles clapped her hands, “Yay for Daddy!” Fred smiled, feeling proud and happy, knowing that with family and friends by his side, they could create wonderful memories together. The day ended with laughter, love, and a big family dinner, reminding everyone just how special it is to have each other.",
