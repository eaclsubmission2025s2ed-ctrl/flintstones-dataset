Just then, Wilma and Betty peeked out the door with bright smiles. \"We have an idea!\" Wilma said, her eyes sparkling. The girls decided to rent out rooms to cheerful student musicians who needed a place to stay. Fred and Barney didn’t know this and thought it was just another boring day. \"Let’s go bowling!\" Fred shouted, but just then, a lively tune floated through the air! Pebbles, with her bright red hair bouncing, danced around Dino, who wagged his tail excitedly. \"Look, Daddy! Music!\" she giggled. Wilma and Betty invited the musicians to play in their backyard, and soon, everyone was tapping their feet to the rhythm. Fred and Barney arrived, confused but curious. \"What’s all this?\" Barney asked, scratching his head. Wilma grinned, \"We’re learning music and dance lessons!\" The musicians twirled and sang, making everyone laugh and clap. Fred was surprised but then said, \"Well, I do love a good dance!\" So, they all danced together under the sun, even Mr. Slate, who popped by to check on Fred. \"This is much better than working!\" he chuckled. As they danced, Pebbles twirled around Dino, who playfully joined in, and everyone felt happy and free. That day, they learned that fun could chase away worries, especially when friends and family danced together!",
