  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Fred was bouncing with excitement as he thought of a way to impress Mr. Slate, his boss at the quarry. “I’ll hire a maid to make a splendid dinner!” he exclaimed, his voice booming through the house. Wilma, with her calm smile, raised an eyebrow and said, “Are you sure that’s a good idea, Fred?” But Fred was already on the phone, hiring a maid named Lollobrickida. When Lollobrickida arrived, Fred couldn’t help but sing a silly song to her. “La-la-la! I’m the best bowler in town!” he sang loudly, making her frown. “I’m sorry, but I quit!” she said, shaking her head, and she rushed out the door. Fred’s face fell, and he exclaimed, “Oh no! What will I do now?” Just then, Wilma had a clever idea. “Don’t worry, Fred! I’ll dress up as the maid!” With a wig and a pretty apron, Wilma transformed into a lovely maid. Pebbles giggled, “You look funny, Mommy!” As dinner time arrived, Barney and Betty came over, curious about the commotion. “What’s going on?” asked Barney with a big smile. “Shh! It’s a surprise for Mr. Slate!” whispered Wilma, trying to keep a straight face. When Mr. Slate arrived, he was surprised to see “the maid” serving dinner. “This is delicious!” he said, munching on a big piece of meat. Fred’s eyes sparkled with joy as he watched Wilma juggle plates and Pebbles dance around Dino, who barked happily. After dinner, Mr. Slate said, “You did a great job, Fred!” Fred beamed with pride, and Wilma winked at him. “Sometimes, it takes a little creativity to make things work!” she said, and everyone laughed, feeling happy and grateful for family and friends.",
