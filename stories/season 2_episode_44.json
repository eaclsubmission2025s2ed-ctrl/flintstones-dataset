  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Fred was so excited about bowling that he made a silly bet with Arnold the paperboy. “I bet you my favorite armchair that I can strike three times in a row!” he boomed, his loud voice echoing through the neighborhood. Wilma, sitting in the kitchen, raised an eyebrow. “Fred, maybe you should think twice before you gamble!” she said calmly, but Fred just laughed. “I’m the best bowler in town!” Fred's best friend Barney cheered, “Go, Fred, go!” Pebbles clapped her little hands, giggling, “Daddy, you can do it!” Dino wagged his tail, bouncing excitedly. Fred bowled his heart out, but oh no! He only knocked down two pins! Arnold grinned, “Looks like I win, Fred! Your armchair and your TV are mine now!” Fred's face fell, and he sighed, “Oh no, what have I done?” \n\nWhen he got home, Wilma hugged him tight. “It’s okay, Fred. We’ll find a way to get our things back.” Betty smiled and said, “Let’s have a yard sale! We can sell things we don’t need and get your furniture back!” Barney nodded eagerly, “I’ll help!” The next day, everyone worked together. Pebbles sold lemonade, Dino chased butterflies, and Wilma and Betty organized the sale. Fred felt better seeing everyone smile as they sold old toys and clothes. At the end of the day, they had enough money to get back Fred's armchair and TV! Fred hugged Wilma and said, “I learned my lesson! No more gambling!” Wilma smiled, “That’s right, Fred. Family and friends are what truly matter!” With Dino barking happily, they all sat together, watching their favorite show on the TV, feeling grateful for each other and their cozy home.",
