  "full_story": "Once upon a time in the cozy town of Bedrock, Fred was feeling very excited because his baby daughter, Pebbles, had just arrived! He wanted to help Wilma, his calm and smart wife, but she was tired from caring for the tiny bundle of joy. “I’ll take care of everything!” Fred boomed, his loud voice echoing through their home. Just then, a nurse sent by Wilma’s mother arrived. “Hello, I’m Nurse Rock!” she said with a big smile, but Fred didn’t like her right away. He puffed up his chest and said, “We don’t need a nurse! I can handle this!” \n\nWilma raised an eyebrow while Barney, Fred’s cheerful friend, peeked in, “Uh-oh, Fred! Are you sure?” But Fred, with his impulsive nature, waved him off. “I know all about babies! Just like Dr. Rock!” he exclaimed, mixing up the baby doctor’s name. Fred tried to bathe Pebbles but accidentally splashed water everywhere! “Oops!” he laughed, while Pebbles giggled, enjoying the fun. Next, he attempted to feed her, but Pebbles just made a funny face and turned her head. “This isn’t as easy as it looks!” he grumbled, scratching his head.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilma and Betty, Barney’s kind wife, shared a knowing glance. “Maybe Fred needs a little help?” Wilma suggested. “Let’s go!” said Betty, and they rushed in, giggling at the sight of Fred in a baby bonnet that Pebbles had tossed at him! “Fred, you’re doing great! Just remember to be gentle,” Wilma said, giving him a wink. With a little help from his friends, Fred learned how to care for Pebbles, and soon, they were all laughing, singing silly songs, and playing peek-a-boo.\n\nBy the end of the day, Fred realized that asking for help was okay. “Thanks, everyone! I couldn’t have done it without you!” he said, hugging Wilma and Pebbles. Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, wagged his tail and barked happily, joining in the family hug. And from that day on, Fred knew that family, friendship, and a little teamwork made everything better. The End!",
