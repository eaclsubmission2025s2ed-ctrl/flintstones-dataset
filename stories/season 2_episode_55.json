  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was feeling grumpy. \"I didn’t get my raise!\" he shouted, stomping his foot. With a loud huff, he wrote an angry letter to Mr. Slate, his boss. Just then, Wilma walked in, her hands on her hips. \"Fred, you should talk to Mr. Slate instead of writing a letter!\" she said calmly. But Fred just waved his arms. \"I’ll show him!\" he exclaimed. Meanwhile, Barney, who was cheerfully munching on a rock cookie, peeked over the fence. \"What’s wrong, Fred?\" he asked, his eyes wide with curiosity. \"I’m getting fired!\" Fred yelled, making Pebbles giggle as she played with Dino. \"You won’t get fired!\" Betty called from her yard. \"Just be patient!\" \n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang, and in walked Mr. Slate, looking serious. \"Fred, I’m here to talk about your raise,\" he said. Fred’s heart raced! He quickly remembered the letter. \"Oh no!\" he gasped, “I need to get it back!\" He tiptoed to the mailbox, but Pebbles was already there, waving the letter high in the air. \"Look, Daddy!\" she laughed. Just then, Dino jumped up, barking happily. \"No, Dino! Not the letter!\" Fred cried, but it was too late! Dino grabbed the letter and ran in circles, making everyone laugh. \n\nMr. Slate chuckled too, and Fred felt relieved. \"I’m sorry, Fred. I did make a mistake. You’re getting your raise!\" he announced. Fred’s face lit up with joy, and he hugged Wilma tightly. \"Hooray!\" shouted Barney, clapping his hands. Betty smiled and said, \"See? It all worked out!\" Pebbles danced around with Dino, and Fred, feeling grateful, learned that sometimes it’s better to talk things out with friends. The day ended with laughter, bowling, and a big family hug, reminding everyone that together, they could face anything!",
