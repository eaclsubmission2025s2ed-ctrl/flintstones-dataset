As they gathered outside, Dino wagged his tail happily, barking, \"Roaaar!\" and nuzzling Fred's leg, ready for the adventure. Mr. Slate, Fred's boss, walked by and raised an eyebrow, saying, \"Just remember to be careful, Fred!\" Fred nodded eagerly, \"Don't worry, Mr. Slate! We’ve got this!\" \n\nWith that, Fred and Barney put on their helmets and pretended to steer a big, imaginary car. \"Vroom, vroom!\" they yelled, zooming around the yard. \"Hold on, Wilma!\" Fred called, pretending to drive. \"Beep beep!\" Pebbles squealed, pretending to be in the backseat, while Wilma chuckled, watching her silly husband and his best friend. Just then, Baby Puss, their fluffy pet, peeked out from behind a rock and meowed curiously. \"Look, it's Baby Puss!\" Betty said with a laugh, joining them to cheer on the rehearsal. \n\nFred and Barney stopped suddenly, their eyes wide. \"Oh no! We forgot to buckle Wilma in!\" Barney exclaimed, scratching his head. Wilma laughed, \"You two are so funny! Let’s practice again.\" They all gathered around, and this time, Fred and Barney made sure to pretend to buckle in Wilma safely. “Hooray!” Pebbles cheered, clapping her hands. Dino barked joyfully, joining the celebration with a happy dance. \n\nAfter their fun rehearsal, Fred beamed with pride. \"We’re ready for the big day!\" he declared. Wilma hugged him tightly, saying, \"I know we will be just fine, especially with our wonderful friends by our side.\" And with everyone smiling, they knew that when the time came, they would be the best family and friends to welcome the new baby into the world!",
