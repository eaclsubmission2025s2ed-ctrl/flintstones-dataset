Uncle Giggles is up to his tricks again!” Wilma, calmly pouring juice for Pebbles, raised an eyebrow and asked, “What did he do this time, Fred?” Fred explained, “He faked his death and said he left me a fortune! But I have to spend the night in his spooky haunted house to get it!” Pebbles clapped her hands, squealing, “I want to go too!” Fred chuckled, “Alright, but only if you promise to be brave!” \n\nBarney and Betty came over just in time to hear Fred’s wild plan. “A haunted house? That sounds exciting!” Barney exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder. “I’ll go with you, Fred! We can face the ghosts together!” Betty nodded, “And I’ll bring some snacks to keep you both strong!” \n\nAs the sun began to set, the friends arrived at Uncle Giggles’ creaky old house. “It looks scary!” Pebbles whispered, clutching Dino, who wagged his tail, ready for an adventure. “Nothing to be afraid of!” Fred said, puffing out his chest. “I’m the bravest man in Bedrock!” \n\nInside, shadows danced on the walls, and strange noises echoed. “Boo!” cried a fake ghost that Uncle Giggles had set up. Fred jumped, but then he laughed, “You almost got me, Uncle Giggles!” Just then, a real spooky sound came from upstairs! “What was that?” Wilma asked, her eyes wide. “Let’s check it out!” said Barney, following Fred up the stairs, with Pebbles and Betty behind them, while Dino barked happily. \n\nAt the top, they found Uncle Giggles, laughing heartily. “I was just playing a trick! There’s no fortune, but you’re all the treasure I need!” Fred sighed with relief, “You scared us, Uncle Giggles!” Wilma smiled and said, “Family and friends are what matter most.” They all laughed together, realizing that the real adventure was being together. Pebbles hugged Dino tightly and declared, “I love our family!” And with that, they headed home, their hearts full of joy and the spirit of friendship.",
