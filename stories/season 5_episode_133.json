The Hatrocks are coming to visit!\" Wilma, calm and practical, raised an eyebrow. \"For how long, Fred?\" she asked, knowing her husband’s big mouth could lead to trouble. \"Just one night!\" he declared, but as the Hatrocks arrived, they quickly took over the Flintstones' cozy home, setting up their stuff everywhere. Pebbles giggled as she watched her parents try to make room for the Hatrocks' big dinosaur toys. \"Can we play, Mommy?\" she asked, bouncing with energy. \"Of course, sweetie!\" Wilma smiled, but soon the Hatrocks were still there, even after a week! Fred scratched his head, realizing his mistake. \"Oops! I talked too much!\" he said sheepishly. Barney, always cheerful, suggested, \"Let’s ask the Gruesomes for help!\" The Flintstones gathered their friends and together they hatched a plan to scare the Hatrocks away with some silly \"bug music.\" The Gruesomes played their goofy instruments, and Fred sang loudly, \"Buzz, buzz, bumblebee!\" The Hatrocks jumped and laughed, but then they decided it was time to head home. \"Thanks for the fun, Fred!\" they shouted as they packed up their things. Pebbles waved goodbye, her face beaming with joy. Wilma sighed with relief, and Fred chuckled, \"Next time, I’ll keep my mouth shut!\" Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, ready for a new adventure with his family.",
