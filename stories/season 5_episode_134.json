  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred burst into the kitchen with a big smile. “Guess what, Wilma? I saw the most amazing luxury apartments!” He waved his arms excitedly. Pebbles giggled and clapped her hands. “Can we live there, Daddy?” Wilma nodded thoughtfully. “It sounds nice, but we need to be careful with our money.” But Fred was already dreaming big. Soon, the family packed up and moved into the shiny apartment! “This is so cool!” Pebbles cheered, bouncing around. But to pay for their new home, Fred took on a secret job as a janitor at the apartment complex. Every evening, he cleaned and scrubbed, but it was tiring! One day, while sweeping the floor, Fred spotted Mr. Slate, his boss from the quarry, coming out of the elevator! “Oh no!” Fred whispered, ducking behind a potted plant. “If Mr. Slate sees me here, he’ll know I’m working two jobs!” Just then, Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, ran up to Fred, wagging his tail. “Shhh, Dino! We need to be quiet!” Fred whispered, trying not to laugh as Dino playfully nudged him. Meanwhile, Barney and Betty arrived to visit. “Hey, Fred! Are you working hard?” Barney asked with a cheerful grin, not noticing Fred’s worried face. “Uh, just cleaning up some crumbs!” Fred chuckled nervously. Wilma, seeing Fred's struggle, smiled and said, “Let’s all help! We can make this fun!” Soon, the whole family joined in, making the apartment sparkle and sing! Pebbles danced with Dino, Barney swept with a big broom, and Betty helped Wilma organize everything. By the time they finished, Fred felt so happy. “I love working with my family!” he exclaimed, realizing that together, they could do anything. And from that day on, Fred learned that it’s not just about living in a fancy place but also about sharing fun times with the people he loved the most!",
