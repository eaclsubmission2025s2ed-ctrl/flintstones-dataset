Remember how we first met Wilma and Betty there?” Barney’s eyes sparkled with excitement as he replied, “Oh yes! I loved their smiles!” They rushed home, and Fred called, “Hey, Wilma! Betty! Let’s go to the Honeyrock!” Wilma, always calm, smiled and said, “That sounds fun, Fred, but we need to hurry. The hotel is in trouble!” Pebbles bounced up and down, her curly red hair bouncing with her, “What’s wrong, Mommy?” Wilma knelt down, “The Honeyrock Hotel might be torn down!” Pebbles gasped, “Oh no! We must save it!” Off they went, with Dino wagging his tail behind them, excited to join the adventure. At the hotel, they found Mr. Slate looking serious. “We can’t let this happen!” Fred exclaimed. Barney nodded, “Let’s tell everyone how special this place is!” Together, they shared stories and laughed about the day they met, making everyone remember the joy of friendship. “That’s right!” said Betty Jean McBricker, smiling brightly. “We had our first dance here!” With everyone’s stories, the townsfolk decided to save the Honeyrock Hotel. Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty cheered, “Hooray for friendship!” And as they celebrated, Pebbles giggled, “Let’s always remember this day!” And so, the Honeyrock Hotel stood tall, filled with love, laughter, and memories, thanks to the best friends in Bedrock!",
