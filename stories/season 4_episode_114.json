I entered our house in the Great Bedrock Clean-Up Contest!” Fred’s eyes widened. “That sounds fun! What do I have to do?” Wilma smiled, “You need to clean the house and make appetizers while I’m at work!” Fred scratched his head but nodded, “No problem!” As soon as Wilma left, Fred rushed around the house, making a big mess! He bumped into Dino, who wagged his tail and barked happily. \"Dino, I need your help!\" Fred shouted, but Dino just chased his own tail. Fred tried to vacuum, but it roared like a dinosaur, making him jump! “Whoa, this is harder than I thought!” he exclaimed. Just then, Barney and Betty popped by, “Hi, Fred! Need a hand?” Betty giggled, “Or maybe a paw from Dino?” Fred laughed, “Yes, please!” Together, they cleaned up the toys, dusted the shelves, and even found Pebbles’ hidden treasures! “Look, a shiny rock!” Pebbles squealed, running to join the fun. Soon, the house sparkled, and Fred set to work on the appetizers. “How about dino-shaped sandwiches?” he suggested, and everyone cheered! With a little help, they made a feast. Finally, when Wilma returned, she gasped in surprise, “Wow, Fred, you did it!” Fred grinned proudly, “Thanks to my friends!” They all hugged, and Dino barked happily, wagging his tail. The house was ready, and the contest was a success, proving that teamwork and love make everything better!",
