You won’t believe what I found!” Pebbles, with her big, curious eyes, bounced up and down, saying, “What is it, Daddy? What is it?” Just then, a playful seal named Dripper splashed into their yard, flopping around with joy. “Woah! A seal!” Fred exclaimed, laughing loudly. Dino, wagging his tail excitedly, barked, “Arf! Arf!” as he ran to greet Dripper. Wilma, with a calm smile, said, “Let’s see if he’s lost, Fred.” Just then, Barney and Betty came over, and Barney grinned, “I love seals! Can we keep him?” Betty chuckled, “Only if we can make a fishy dinner for him!” But suddenly, a stern man appeared, shouting, “Dripper, come here!” It was Dripper's trainer, trying to catch the slippery seal! “No way!” Fred declared, his voice booming. “Dripper is our friend!” Pebbles cheered, “Let’s help him!” So, they all worked together. Wilma smartly suggested, “Let’s distract the trainer!” While Barney danced and sang silly songs, Fred and Dino played catch with Dripper, making him flip and splash everywhere! The trainer got confused and shouted, “Where did he go?” Just then, Dripper splashed water straight into the trainer’s face! Everyone giggled, and Dripper swam away, safe and happy. “Hooray for teamwork!” shouted Pebbles, hugging Dino, while Fred and Wilma smiled at their friends. “Family and friends are the best!” Fred said, and everyone cheered, enjoying their sunny day together.",
