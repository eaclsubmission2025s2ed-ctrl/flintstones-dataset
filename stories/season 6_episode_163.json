  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was getting ready for another exciting day at the quarry when he heard a loud knock at the door. “Who could that be?” he wondered, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. When he opened the door, he saw Wilma’s childhood friend, a tall and handsome man named Charlie, standing there with a big smile. “Hello, Wilma! I’m back in town!” he said cheerfully. Fred’s face turned grumpy, and his loud voice boomed, “Who invited you?” Wilma quickly stepped in, her calm smile shining like the sun. “Fred, it’s just Charlie! He’s here to visit!” But Fred couldn’t help but feel jealous. “I’m the best friend here!” he huffed, crossing his arms. With a twinkle in her eye, Wilma said, “Fred, you’re my favorite! Let’s all go bowling together!” “Bowling sounds fun!” Charlie cheered, and Fred’s frown slowly turned into a grin. As they rolled the balls down the lane, Fred learned that friendship is all about having fun together, not just being the best. And by the end of the day, Fred laughed so hard, he forgot all about his jealousy. “You know what, Charlie? You’re okay!” he said, giving a friendly pat on Charlie’s back. The three of them shared smiles and laughter, reminding Fred that love and friendship are the best wins of all!",
