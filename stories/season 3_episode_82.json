  "full_story": "Once upon a time in Bedrock, Fred Flintstone was feeling a little worried. “Oh, Wilma, we need more money for our new baby!” he exclaimed, scratching his head with a loud sigh. His calm and practical wife, Wilma, smiled gently and said, “Why don’t you ask Mr. Slate for a raise, Fred?” With a big grin, Fred decided to march to the quarry to talk to his boss. But when he got there, Mr. Slate was acting very serious. “Fred,” he said, crossing his arms, “I just fired another worker for asking for a raise!” Fred’s eyes widened in shock. “Oh no!” he gasped, but just then, his cheerful best friend Barney peeked in wearing a funny mustache. “I’m here to hire Fred for twice the money!” he declared, making Fred giggle. But Mr. Slate frowned and said, “Sorry, Fred, but you’re fired too… for your own good!” Fred couldn’t believe it! \n\n“Oh no, what will I do?” he cried, running home to tell Wilma. Pebbles jumped up and down, “Daddy, Daddy! You’ll find a new job!” So Fred tried to find work everywhere. He became a waiter, but he spilled spaghetti everywhere! He tried being a rock musician, but he couldn’t find the beat! “This isn’t working!” he moaned, feeling sad. Just when he thought all hope was lost, Fred saw a circus poster. “I’ll be a clown!” he cheered, putting on a red nose and big shoes. But while he was juggling, Mr. Slate appeared, shaking his head. “Fred, what are you doing?” he asked, trying not to laugh. \n\nFred scratched his head and said, “I’m trying to make money!” Mr. Slate chuckled, “Well, how about I give you a big raise and let you come back to the quarry?” Fred’s eyes lit up like stars! “Really? That’s amazing!” he shouted, giving Mr. Slate a big bear hug. When he returned home, Wilma, Pebbles, and Dino the dinosaur jumped up in excitement. “Daddy’s back!” Pebbles cried, and Dino wagged his tail, giving Fred a happy lick. “Now we can welcome our new baby!” said Wilma, hugging Fred tight. And together, they celebrated with laughter and joy, knowing that family and friendship were the best treasures of all.",
