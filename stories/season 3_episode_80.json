  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred woke up with a frown. “Oh no! My mother-in-law is visiting!” he exclaimed, flinging his bowling ball aside. Wilma, with her calm smile, said, “Don’t worry, Fred. She’s here to help us get ready for the new baby!” But Fred’s loud voice echoed, “I just want peace and quiet!” As the door swung open, in walked Fred’s mother-in-law with a big, cheerful smile and a suitcase full of baby things. “Time to get to work!” she said. Fred felt his heart sink. So, he decided to put on a disguise and become a cab driver! “I’ll earn some money and escape!” he chuckled. With a bright yellow cap on his head, Fred hopped into his cab, ready for adventure! He zoomed down the street, and who should hop in but his mother-in-law! “Taxi!” she called, and Fred’s eyes widened. “Oh no, not her!” he thought, but he smiled and said, “Where to, ma’am?” As they drove around the town, Fred learned about all the places his mother-in-law loved, like the bakery with the best chocolate chip cookies and the park where Pebbles played. “This isn’t so bad!” he thought, laughing with her as they shared funny stories. Meanwhile, Barney and Betty watched in surprise as they passed by. “Look at Fred in that cab!” Barney giggled. “He looks silly!” Betty smiled and said, “He’s just trying to help.” By the end of the night, Fred counted his money and realized he had made enough to buy a special surprise for Wilma and Pebbles. When he returned home, his mother-in-law hugged him tightly. “Thank you for the ride, Fred! You’re a good son-in-law!” Fred beamed with happiness, and Wilma gave him a kiss on the cheek. “You did great today, Fred!” she said. Fred laughed, feeling warm inside. “Maybe having family around isn’t so bad after all!” And with Dino wagging his tail, they all shared cookies and stories, filling their home with joy and love.",
