  "full_story": "Once upon a time in Bedrock, Fred Flintstone was bowling with his friends. \"Strike!\" he shouted, his voice booming with excitement. But just as he was about to celebrate, he spotted a strange-looking family moving in next door. \"Oh no! Not the Gruesomes!\" Fred groaned, remembering how odd they were. Meanwhile, Wilma, with her calm smile, said, \"Let’s be friendly, Fred. They might be nice!\" \n\nBarney, always cheerful, jumped in, \"I bet they just want to make new friends!\" Betty nodded, \"Let’s invite them over for a barbecue!\" Pebbles giggled and clapped her hands, \"Can Dino come too?\" Dino barked happily, wagging his tail like a puppy. \n\nLater that evening, the Gruesomes arrived. Weirdly, with his wild hair, smiled awkwardly. \"Hello! We brought some ghost-shaped cookies!\" he said, holding out a tray. \"Yummy!\" Pebbles squealed, eyes sparkling. Goblin and Creepella, Weirdly’s family members, looked a bit shy but waved. Fred tried to be brave, “Uh... thanks!” but he couldn’t help feeling nervous. \n\nAs the evening went on, they all played games together. Barney laughed as Goblin tried to juggle rocks, but they kept falling. \"Oops!\" Goblin said with a goofy grin. Creepella showed Wilma how to make spooky shadow puppets, making everyone giggle. Fred realized that the Gruesomes weren’t so scary after all! \n\nBy the end of the night, Fred smiled wide and said, \"Maybe having new neighbors isn’t so bad!\" The Gruesomes waved goodbye, and Pebbles shouted, \"Can we be friends forever?\" Dino barked in agreement, and everyone laughed, feeling happy. They learned that friendship can be found in the most unexpected places!",
