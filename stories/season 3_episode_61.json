Barney and Betty came over, and Fred couldn’t wait to share his big idea. “Let’s have Dino audition for the show!” he declared. “Oh, that sounds fun!” said Barney, grinning widely. \n\nLater that day, they set up a stage in their backyard. Fred held a microphone, and Dino wagged his tail, ready to impress everyone. “Okay, Dino! Show us your best trick!” Fred called out. Dino jumped and twirled, making Pebbles clap her hands in delight. “Go, Dino, go!” she cheered. Wilma watched proudly while Betty cheered along with Pebbles. \n\nAs Dino performed, Fred couldn’t help but dream of all the shiny things they could buy. “We’ll have a big house and the coolest toys!” he said, his voice booming with excitement. But then, Mr. Slate, Fred’s boss, came by and said, “Fred, remember that family is more important than money!” Fred paused and looked at Wilma, Pebbles, and Dino, who were all smiling at him. \n\nIn that moment, Fred realized something important. “You’re right, Mr. Slate! I just want to see Dino happy!” he said. So instead of thinking about money, Fred decided to enjoy watching Dino shine. They all laughed and played together, and Dino was the happiest star of all.
