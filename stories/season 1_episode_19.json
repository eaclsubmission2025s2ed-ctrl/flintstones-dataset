  "full_story": "It was a sunny morning in Bedrock, and Fred Flintstone was buzzing with excitement! “Today’s my anniversary with Wilma!” he shouted, almost bouncing off the walls of their cozy cave. But oh no, he only remembered because it was \"Trash Day!\" Fred raced to the quarry, where he told his best friend Barney, “I want to buy Wilma a beautiful Stoneway piano!” Barney’s eyes sparkled. “That sounds great, Fred!” he said with a grin, ready to help. They rushed to a fancy music store, but Fred felt nervous when the snooty clerk, Frank Nelson, frowned at him. “This piano is too expensive for you!” he sneered. Fred’s heart sank, but Barney cheerfully said, “Don’t worry, Fred! We’ll find another way!” \n\nThen, they met a mysterious man named “88 Fingers Louie,” who promised a great deal for a piano, but he looked a little shady. “Cash only!” Louie chuckled, rubbing his hands together. Fred, eager to impress Wilma, handed over his savings quickly. Back home, he couldn’t wait to see Wilma’s face when she opened her surprise. “Dino! Can you help me?” he called, and Dino happily wagged his tail, ready to lend a paw. \n\nBut when the piano arrived, it made the strangest sounds! Instead of beautiful music, it honked like a horn and squeaked like a toy. “Oh no!” Fred exclaimed, scratching his head. “This isn’t what I wanted!” Just then, Wilma walked in, her eyes wide with surprise. “Fred, what is going on?” she asked. Fred sighed, feeling a little embarrassed. “I wanted to get you a lovely piano for our anniversary, but I messed up.” \n\nBarney stepped forward, “Don’t worry, Fred! We’ll fix this together!” He winked at the cheerful Pebbles, who was bouncing with excitement. “Let’s sing a song to celebrate our friendship!” she giggled. So, with the help of Dino and Betty, they all gathered around the funny piano. Barney played the silly tune, and everyone joined in singing the “Happy Anniversary” song. The four friendly police officers joined in, clapping and dancing, and soon, everyone was laughing and having fun! \n\nWilma smiled, her heart filled with love. “This is the best anniversary surprise ever!” Fred grinned, feeling happy because he realized it wasn’t about the piano, but the joy of being together as a family. And that day in Bedrock, they learned that love and laughter are the best gifts of all!",
