Fred’s loud voice echoed through their home as he said, “Oh boy, I can’t wait to see Mom-in-law! I mean... uh, I can wait!” Wilma, with her calm smile, replied, “Just remember to be nice, Fred!” Pebbles giggled, her little pigtails bouncing as she said, “I can’t wait to show Grandma my drawings!” Just then, Dino the playful dinosaur dashed in, wagging his tail and barking happily, “Woof! Woof!” He couldn’t wait to meet Grandma either! When Mrs. Slaghoople arrived, she hugged Wilma tightly and said, “Oh, my dear! I’ve brought cookies!” Fred’s eyes widened at the thought of cookies, but then he sighed, thinking of how he could sneak away to go bowling instead. “Uh, I think I left something in the quarry,” he said sheepishly. Wilma raised an eyebrow, knowing Fred’s tricks. Meanwhile, Barney and Betty popped in with big smiles. “Hello, everyone! We brought lemonade!” Barney said with a cheerful grin. Betty added, “And we can all play games together!” But Fred just wanted to escape. “Maybe we should go bowling, eh, Barney?” he whispered. “Bowling sounds great!” Barney exclaimed, always ready for an adventure. But Pebbles tugged at Fred’s shirt, saying, “Daddy, can we play with Grandma first?” Fred looked at her bright eyes and felt his heart soften. “Alright, let’s play a game!” he said, smiling. They all gathered for fun, laughter filling the air as Mrs. Slaghoople shared stories while Dino chased after Pebbles, wagging his tail. Fred realized that spending time with family was the best adventure of all, even better than bowling! And as the sun began to set, Fred thought, “Maybe I can bowl another day!”",
