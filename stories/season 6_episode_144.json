They sat in a big room filled with people, and soon they had to decide if a man called \"The Mangler\" was guilty of robbing a store. “He’s guilty!” Fred declared, waving his arms. Barney nodded eagerly, “Yeah! Let’s say he is!” The jury agreed, and Fred felt proud. But The Mangler didn’t like the decision. “I’ll get even with you, Fred!” he growled angrily as he was led away. The next day, Fred woke up to Dino barking excitedly. “What is it, Dino?” Fred asked, scratching his head. Just then, the news flashed on the TV: The Mangler had escaped! “Oh no!” Fred gasped, his heart racing. “He might come after me!” Wilma walked in with a calm smile. “Don’t worry, Fred. We’ll be safe together!” she said, giving him a reassuring hug. Pebbles peeked out from behind Wilma, her big eyes full of curiosity. “Daddy, are we going to catch the bad guy?” she asked, bouncing on her toes. “Yes! We’ll be brave!” Fred replied, feeling stronger with his family by his side. Barney, always cheerful, chimed in, “Let’s find him together!” So, the friends and their families teamed up. They searched high and low, asking Dino to sniff for clues. “Woof! Woof!” Dino barked happily, leading them to the park. Suddenly, they spotted The Mangler hiding behind a tree! “There he is!” Fred shouted, but instead of being scared, he took a deep breath. “Let’s talk to him!” With Wilma and Betty supporting him, Fred bravely approached. “The Mangler, it’s not too late to be good!” he said warmly. The Mangler looked surprised. “You really think I can change?” he asked, scratching his head. “Yes! Everyone can be better!” Barney added with a big grin. With a little encouragement from Fred and Barney, The Mangler realized he didn’t have to be bad. In the end, he decided to return to the police and apologize. Everyone cheered, and Pebbles clapped her hands. “Hooray for friendship!” she exclaimed. Fred smiled at his family and friends, feeling happy and safe. “Together, we can do anything!” he said, as Dino wagged his tail, ready for their next adventure.",
