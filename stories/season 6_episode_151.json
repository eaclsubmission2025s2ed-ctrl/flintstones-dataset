  "full_story": "Once upon a time in the lively town of Bedrock, Fred and his best friend Barney were buzzing with excitement about a costume contest at the Water Buffalo Lodge! “Let’s be devils, Barney!” Fred shouted, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Barney grinned, his eyes sparkling, “That sounds fun, Fred!” They hurried to get their red capes and pointy horns. But when they started play-fighting in their costumes, they made such a ruckus that the police came to check on them! “What’s all this noise?” Officer Pebble asked, raising an eyebrow. Meanwhile, a new band called the Way-Outs was playing on the radio, announcing that Bedrock was being invaded by space aliens! Pebbles, Fred’s adorable daughter, jumped up and down in excitement, “Wow! Aliens are coming, Daddy!” Fred had an idea. “Barney, why don’t you stay as the devil, and I’ll be a space alien!” Barney nodded eagerly, “Okay, Fred!” Fred put on a shiny silver outfit and a big, silly helmet. As he strutted down the street, everyone pointed and gasped, thinking he really was an alien! Suddenly, there was a big commotion when Fred accidentally bumped into Mr. Slate, his boss. “Watch it, Fred!” Mr. Slate said, looking stern but then chuckling when he saw the silly costume. Just then, the police, having received lots of calls about the “alien,” arrived at the contest. Officer Pebble said, “Let’s clear this up!” The radio DJ, scared of the police, admitted it was all a joke about the Way-Outs. The townsfolk laughed, and Fred was awarded a shiny trophy for the best costume! “Hooray for Fred!” cheered Wilma, while Betty clapped for Barney. And as the Way-Outs played a happy tune, Fred danced and sang with them, showing everyone that sometimes a little mix-up can lead to great fun!",
