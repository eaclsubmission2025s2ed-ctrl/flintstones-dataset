  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Fred was bowling with Barney at the quarry. “Strike!” Fred shouted, throwing his ball with a big grin. Just then, Pebbles and Wilma waved from the sidelines, cheering for their dads. Suddenly, they heard a loud clatter! A runaway baby carriage was zooming down the street! “Look out!” Fred yelled, but before he could move, Barney dashed straight into action. “I can save the day!” he shouted, running after the carriage. With a big leap, he caught the carriage just in time, and everyone cheered! “Hooray for Barney!” they shouted. But when the reporters and police arrived, Fred quickly took the baby from Barney’s arms and said, “Look at me! I’m the hero!” Barney looked confused but smiled, happy for his friend. However, deep inside, Fred felt a tickle of guilt. “Was I really the hero?” he wondered, scratching his head. Later, as they shared ice cream with Betty and Wilma, Fred looked at Barney and said, “You were so brave, buddy! You saved that baby!” Barney beamed with pride. Fred realized it was much better to share the glory. “Let’s be heroes together!” he declared, and they all laughed, knowing that friendship was the best kind of heroism.",
