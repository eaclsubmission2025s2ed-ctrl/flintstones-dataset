  "full_story": "Once upon a time in the bustling town of Bedrock, the King of Stonesylvania was coming for a visit! Fred, a loud and impulsive man who loved bowling, was bursting with excitement. \"I can’t wait to meet the king!\" he shouted, his voice echoing. Wilma, his calm and smart wife, smiled and reminded him, \"Just remember to be on your best behavior, dear.\" Meanwhile, Barney, Fred’s cheerful best friend, bounced beside him, \"I’ll be right there with you, Fred!\" When the king arrived, he looked just like Fred! The townsfolk gasped, and Mr. Slate, Fred's boss, quickly hired Fred to pretend to be the king. \"Just don’t mess it up!\" he warned sternly. \n\nFred put on a shiny crown and a big robe, feeling very important. But soon, he realized being a king was not fun at all! The king was grumpy and didn’t like the noisy, busy world outside his castle. “This is too loud!” he complained, covering his ears. Fred sighed, “I just want to go bowling!” When Wilma saw the king, she thought it was Fred! “Oh, my dear, you look so royal!” she exclaimed, hugging him tightly. The king was confused and said, “Royal? What does that even mean?” \n\nPebbles, Fred and Wilma’s giggly daughter, peeked in and said, “Daddy, are you playing dress-up?” Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, wagged his tail, barking happily at the king, who jumped back in surprise. “I’m not ready for this!” the king cried! Fred, feeling a bit silly, decided to teach the king how to have fun. “Let’s go bowling!” he shouted. The king hesitated but finally agreed, and soon they were rolling bowling balls down the lane, laughing together! \n\nAs they played, Fred learned to say, “The rotskin spotskin is motskin on the plotskin!” which made everyone giggle, especially Barney, who couldn’t stop laughing! In the end, Fred, the king, and all their friends had the best time together. Fred realized being a king wasn’t so bad when you had friends and family by your side. And the king? He decided that being a normal person was much more fun than being a king! With big smiles, they all headed home, excited for their next adventure.",
