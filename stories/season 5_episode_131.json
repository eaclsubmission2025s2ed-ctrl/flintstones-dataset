  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred rushed home with a huge grin, waving his hands excitedly. “Wilma! Look what I got!” he shouted, revealing a shiny, old gangster's car he bought at a police auction. Pebbles jumped up and down, squealing, “Wow, Daddy! It looks like a racecar!” Wilma raised an eyebrow, her calm voice saying, “Fred, are you sure it’s safe?” But Fred just chuckled, “Don’t worry! It’ll be fun!” Later, as Fred and Barney admired the car, Dino barked happily, wagging his tail, “Woof, woof!” Suddenly, three tough-looking gangsters, led by Big Sparkle, came creeping down the street. “That’s our car!” Big Sparkle shouted angrily. Fred gulped, and Barney’s eyes went wide. “Uh-oh!” said Barney, clinging to Fred’s arm. They quickly hopped into the car, and Pebbles giggled, “Let’s go, Daddy!” With Dino barking and wagging his tail, they zoomed off, tires squealing. “I’ll drive fast!” Fred yelled, his heart racing with excitement and a little bit of fear. Wilma and Betty watched from the porch, worried but ready to help. “We need a plan!” said Wilma, her mind racing. Betty nodded, “Let’s distract them!” The two wives gathered their friends and set up a lemonade stand right in front of their house. When the gangsters saw the lemonade, they stopped to sip and chat, forgetting all about Fred and Barney! “Yummy!” Big Sparkle smiled, sipping his drink, while Fred and Barney peeked out from behind a bush, relieved. “Phew! That was close!” Fred laughed, and Barney giggled, “Let’s get home!” As they drove back, Pebbles cheered, “That was the best adventure ever!” Dino barked in agreement, and with family and friends by their side, Fred realized that the best fun comes from sticking together!",
