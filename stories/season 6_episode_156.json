  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred was getting ready to watch his favorite bowling show when he suddenly sneezed! \"ACHOO!\" His loud sneeze was so powerful that it made a big hole in the TV screen! \"Oh no!\" Fred exclaimed, looking worried. Wilma, his calm and sensible wife, rushed in and said, \"Don’t worry, Fred! We can fix it later.\" Just then, Barney popped his head over the fence, grinning. \"What happened, Fred?\" he asked, his cheerful voice ringing out. \"I sneezed a hole in the TV, Barney!\" said Fred, scratching his head. Pebbles giggled and said, “Daddy, you made a funny noise!” Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, barked happily, wagging his tail. Fred, feeling frustrated, decided to visit the store to buy some medicine called \"Scram\" that would help with his sneezes. When he got home, he took the medicine, but suddenly, he felt funny! “What’s happening?” he shouted, and with a big poof, he turned into a silly ape! “Look at me!” laughed Pebbles, clapping her hands. Wilma raised an eyebrow but smiled, “Fred, you’re just a big, silly ape now!” Barney cheered, “Let’s have fun, Fred!” They all played together, swinging from the furniture and laughing. But then Mr. Slate knocked on the door, looking stern. “Fred, I need you at the quarry!” he said, but when he saw Fred the ape, he couldn’t help but laugh. “You’ll have to come back when you’re yourself!” Finally, with a tickle from Pebbles and a little help from Wilma, Fred took another dose of medicine and turned back into his old self. “Phew! I’m back!” he said, relieved. They all cheered, and Fred hugged his family tight. “No more sneezes, please!” he chuckled, and everyone laughed, ready for their next adventure together!",
