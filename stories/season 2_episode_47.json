  "full_story": "In the cheerful town of Bedrock, Fred was bouncing with excitement. \"I need a new bowling ball!\" he shouted, his loud voice echoing through the house. But Fred didn’t have enough money. So, with a mischievous grin, he peeked into Wilma’s purse and took out some cash, thinking he could buy the ball without her knowing. “It’s just a quick trip!” he said to himself, rushing out the door. Little did he know, Wilma was right behind him, planning a surprise for him. “I saved up to buy Fred that bowling ball for his birthday!” she whispered to Pebbles, who giggled with delight. \n\nMeanwhile, at the quarry, Fred showed up with a shiny new bowling ball, his eyes sparkling with joy. “Look what I got!” he boomed, but Mr. Slate raised an eyebrow. “Did you steal that?” he asked sternly. Fred gulped and replied, “No way! A burglar took it!” Back at home, Wilma was puzzled. “Fred, did you see my money?” she asked, crossing her arms with a frown. Just then, Barney and Betty popped by. “What’s going on?” Barney asked cheerfully. Fred felt guilty but wanted to keep his secret. “Uh, it’s nothing!” he said too loudly.\n\nLater that evening, Wilma brought out a big, wrapped box. “Happy birthday, Fred!” she said with a warm smile. Fred’s heart sank. “Oh no, she was going to buy me a ball!” he thought. When he opened the box and saw the bowling ball, he felt a wave of shame wash over him. “I’m sorry, Wilma! I took your money because I wanted it first,” he confessed, looking down. Wilma smiled gently, “I was going to surprise you!” \n\nFred took a deep breath. “I should have asked you. Let’s return this ball together,” he suggested. Pebbles clapped her hands, “Yay! Family teamwork!” Dino wagged his tail, excited to help. With Barney and Betty by their side, they all went back to the store, and Fred returned the ball. “I promise to always be honest with you, Wilma,” he said, feeling lighter. Wilma hugged him tight, “And I’ll always surprise you!” They all laughed, and Fred knew that the best gift of all was having a loving family and friends. And from that day on, Fred never took anything without asking again!",
