  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was at the bowling alley, shouting excitedly, “Strike! I got a strike!” His cheerful laughter echoed as Barney cheered beside him, “Way to go, Fred!” But suddenly, ten funny-looking robots that looked just like Fred zoomed into the bowling alley! “What in the world?!” Fred exclaimed, his eyes wide with surprise. The robots began to bowl wildly, knocking down pins and even bumping into Mr. Slate, who was not amused. “Fred! Control your clones!” he shouted, scowling. Outside, Pebbles watched with her wide, curious eyes, “Look, Mommy! More Daddies!” Wilma shook her head, trying to stay calm. “Oh, dear! We need to stop them before they cause more trouble!” she said, holding Pebbles’ hand tightly. Just then, Dino dashed over, barking happily, thinking the robots were new friends! “Dino, no!” Fred shouted, but it was too late; Dino was already chasing a robot, wagging his tail. Betty joined Wilma, saying, “Let’s gather the kids! Maybe they can help!” Together, Pebbles and her friends threw soft balls at the robots, and one by one, they began to fall over with silly clunks! “We're winning!” Pebbles giggled as she jumped up and down. Finally, the last robot stumbled and fell right into Mr. Slate's arms, who surprisingly chuckled, “Alright, Fred, you’ve made your point. Now let’s get these robots back to their makers.” Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty cheered together, knowing that with teamwork and a little laughter, they could solve any problem—even one as silly as ten Fred look-alikes! And as the sun set over Bedrock, Dino snuggled beside Fred, who said, “No more robots, please!” Everyone laughed, happy and safe at home.",
