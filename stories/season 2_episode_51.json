  "full_story": "In the sunny town of Bedrock, Wilma was bustling around in the kitchen, making her famous stone soup when Mr. Rockenschpeel knocked on the door. \"Hello, Wilma! How would you like to host a cooking show called 'The Happy Housewife'?\" he asked with a big smile. Wilma’s eyes sparkled with excitement! \"Oh, that sounds fun!\" she exclaimed. Meanwhile, Fred was at the quarry, dreaming of his favorite meatloaf dinner. \"Wilma, where’s my dinner?\" he shouted when he got home. But Wilma was too busy filming her cooking show! She wore a bright apron and sang, “(Won't You Come Home) Bill Bailey” as she mixed ingredients. Pebbles clapped her little hands, laughing, “Go, Mommy!” Fred crossed his arms, feeling like a grumpy dinosaur. “No dinner? This is not fair!” he complained. Barney, always cheerful, tried to cheer him up. “Hey, Fred! Let’s watch Wilma on TV!” But Fred just huffed. “I want her cooking, not her on TV!” \n\nAs the days went by, everyone in Bedrock loved Wilma’s show. Betty even giggled, “She’s the best chef!” But Fred was a “not-so-happy pappy.” One evening, Dino jumped up and down, wagging his tail, trying to cheer Fred. “Rrruff! Rrruff!” Fred sighed. “I miss my wife’s cooking!” Just then, Wilma came home, her face glowing with happiness. “Fred! I baked your favorite meatloaf!” she said, holding a steaming dish. Fred’s frown turned upside down. “Yay!” he cheered, rushing to the table. They all sat down together, with Pebbles bouncing in her chair. “Mommy, you’re the best!” she squealed. Fred smiled wide, realizing that even though Wilma was a star on TV, she was still his star at home. They all laughed, shared stories, and enjoyed their dinner, feeling grateful for family and friendship. And as Dino licked the crumbs off the table, everyone agreed Bedrock was the happiest place to be!",
