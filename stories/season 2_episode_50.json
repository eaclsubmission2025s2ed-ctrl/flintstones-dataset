Barney’s eyes sparkled, and he nodded eagerly, “Oh boy, that sounds fun!” But just as they were about to leave, Barney remembered he had to see the company's nurse. “Oh no, Fred! I forgot!” said Barney, his smile fading.\n\nFred, with a mischievous grin, said, “Don’t worry, I can fix this!” He got a thermometer and pretended to check Barney’s temperature. “You have a 312-degree fever!” he declared, his voice booming again. “We need to get you to the hospital!” The nurse, hearing this, gasped and rushed them to the hospital. “Oh dear!” she exclaimed, “We must take care of you right away!”\n\nOnce inside the hospital, Fred put on a white coat he found and pretended to be a doctor. “Time for your operation, Barney!” he said dramatically, waving a toy dinosaur like a scalpel. “This will make you feel better!” Barney giggled, but then he said, “Wait, Fred! This isn’t how a real doctor behaves!”\n\nJust then, Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, burst into the room, barking happily. “Ruff! Ruff!” he said, and Fred jumped, laughing. “See, Barney? Even Dino thinks it’s time to go!” With a wink to his friend, Fred led Barney out of the hospital, dodging nurses and giggling all the way. \n\nFinally, they hurried to the ballpark, only to find it was evening, not afternoon! “Oh no!” Fred exclaimed, his face falling. “Mr. Slate had tickets for us!” Barney sighed, “But we missed it because I was ‘sick’!” Just then, Betty and Wilma appeared with Pebbles, who was bouncing with excitement. “We heard you two were in trouble!” said Wilma, shaking her head with a smile. “But we have a surprise for you!” \n\nPebbles jumped up and down, “We got you ice cream instead!” The friends laughed and realized that even though they missed the game, they had each other and lots of fun waiting ahead. “Next time, let’s be responsible!” Fred said, giving Barney a friendly nudge. And together, they all enjoyed their ice cream under the bright, smiling sun.",
