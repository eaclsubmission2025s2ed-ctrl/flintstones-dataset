It’s cheaper!” Barney’s eyes sparkled with eagerness, “That sounds fun, Fred!” So, they put on colorful dresses, big hats, and even some silly lipstick! \n\nAs they walked to the game, Pebbles giggled and said, “You look funny, Daddy!” Dino wagged his tail and barked happily, thinking they were playing a game. When they got to the baseball stadium, Wilma and Betty were already there, laughing at Fred and Barney’s silly outfits. “You two are the funniest ladies I’ve ever seen!” Betty chuckled, and Wilma just shook her head with a smile, “Oh, Fred!”\n\nInside the stadium, Fred and Barney cheered loudly for their favorite team, waving their arms and jumping up and down. “Go, team, go!” Fred shouted, not caring that he was in a dress. Everyone around them laughed and joined in. Suddenly, Mr. Slate, Fred’s boss, walked by and raised an eyebrow, “What in the quarry are you two doing?” Fred and Barney just giggled, and Fred replied, “We’re here to have fun, Mr. Slate!”\n\nAs the game went on, Pebbles and Dino cheered from the stands, and soon everyone was having a great time. Fred realized that dressing up was silly but brought everyone together. At the end of the game, with smiles on their faces, Fred and Barney said, “Next time, let’s just buy tickets!” And they all laughed, enjoying the special day together with family and friends.",
