His best friend, Barney Rubble, was spending so much time taking care of his nephew Marblehead that Fred felt alone. \"Hey, Barney! Don’t you want to go bowling with me?\" Fred shouted, waving his arms. But Barney just smiled and said, \"I can’t, Fred! Marblehead needs me!\" Fred's loud voice echoed through the neighborhood, and Pebbles, his cheerful daughter, peeked out from behind the door. \"Daddy, why are you frowning?\" she asked with her big, curious eyes. \"I miss Barney!\" Fred huffed, crossing his arms. Meanwhile, Wilma, Fred's calm and smart wife, saw how sad he was. \"Maybe you should talk to Barney about how you feel,\" she suggested gently. Just then, Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, bounced into the room, barking happily and wagging his tail. \"Dino! You know how to cheer me up!\" Fred chuckled, giving Dino a scratch behind the ears. Later that day, Fred marched over to Barney's house, ready to tell him how he felt. But when he arrived, he saw Barney and Marblehead laughing and playing. Fred felt a little better seeing his friend so happy but still shouted, “Hey, Barney! I miss you!” Barney turned, his cheerful face lighting up. “I miss you too, Fred! Let’s go bowling tomorrow!” Just as they were about to leave, Wilma called everyone inside. “I have exciting news!” she said, her eyes sparkling. “Fred, we’re going to have a baby!” Fred turned to the readers with a big grin, “Can you believe it? The Flintstones are going to have a baby!” Everyone cheered, and Fred felt happier than ever, knowing that family and friends were what really mattered.",
