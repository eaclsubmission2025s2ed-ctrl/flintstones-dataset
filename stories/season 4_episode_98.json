Betty giggled, \"That sounds great! They will spoil us!\" But little did they know, Fred and Barney were secretly listening behind the couch, eyes wide with surprise! \"Did they say mink coats?\" Fred exclaimed, scratching his head. Barney’s eyes sparkled with mischief, \"Let’s pretend we’re planning to steal them!\" The next day, Fred and Barney put on their sneakiest faces and tiptoed around the house, whispering, \"We’ll be the best husbands ever!\" Wilma and Betty watched, wide-eyed and confused. \"What are they up to?\" Wilma asked, trying not to giggle. Just then, Dino bounced in, wagging his tail, \"Roooaaar!\" which made everyone burst into laughter. Finally, Fred and Barney revealed their silly plan, and all four friends laughed together. \"No stealing, just love and laughter!\" said Betty, giving Barney a hug. And from that day on, they decided to spoil each other with kindness instead of gifts, proving that love is the best treasure of all!",
