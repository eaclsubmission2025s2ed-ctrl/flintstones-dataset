  "full_story": "One sunny Saturday, Fred and Barney were bouncing with excitement because they had tickets to see a wrestling match! “I can’t wait to cheer for my favorite wrestler!” Fred shouted, his loud voice echoing through the neighborhood. But just then, Wilma walked up, her calm smile shining like the sun. “Fred, you and Barney have to babysit Edna Boulder's son, Egbert,” she said. “He’s too little to go to the match.” Fred sighed, “Oh boy, babysitting!” But Barney, cheerful as always, said, “Let’s make it fun!” \n\nSo, with Pebbles giggling and Dino wagging his tail, Fred and Barney welcomed little Egbert, who was full of energy! “Let’s play!” Egbert said, bouncing on his toes. “But first, we have to go to Joe Rockhead’s house to watch the match on his TV!” Fred exclaimed, and off they went, holding Egbert’s tiny hands. \n\nAt Joe’s house, they settled down with popcorn, but suddenly, the lights went out! “Oh no! The blackout!” Fred cried. “We can’t see the match!” Just then, Barney whispered, “What if Egbert ran away in the dark?” They both jumped up, worried faces and wild thoughts swirling. “Egbert! Where are you?” they yelled, searching the dark corners of the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Egbert had found a cozy spot under the couch, giggling to himself, “This is a perfect hiding place!” But Fred and Barney, thinking he was lost, rushed out of the house and into the street, shouting for help. Just then, Mr. Slate, Fred’s boss, came by and raised an eyebrow. “What’s all this ruckus?” he asked, looking stern. \n\nIn the middle of their frantic searching, they accidentally bumped into Joe, who was also looking for Egbert! “I’m sure he’s just playing hide-and-seek!” Joe chuckled. But just as they were about to find Egbert, a police officer arrived, thinking there was trouble. “What’s going on here?” the officer asked, and soon, all three—Fred, Barney, and Joe—found themselves in a silly misunderstanding that led to them getting arrested for making noise!\n\nMeanwhile, Wilma and Betty were having their own fun, sipping lemonade and giggling, unaware of the chaos. When they found out, they rushed to the police station, shaking their heads but smiling. “Boys will be boys!” Betty laughed. “Let’s get them out!” \n\nWhen Fred and Barney finally hugged Egbert, who had just come out from under the couch, they all burst into laughter, realizing that sometimes adventures can go a little silly but always end with a happy heart. “Next time, let’s just watch the match at home!” Fred said, and everyone agreed, smiling wide. And with Pebbles and Dino leading the way, they all headed home together, happy and ready for the next fun-filled day!",
