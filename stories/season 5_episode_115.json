  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was excitedly planning a bowling trip with Barney. “Let’s roll some strikes, buddy!” he shouted, clapping his hands. Meanwhile, in the next yard, Barney and Betty were introducing their new pet, Hoppy, a fluffy little rabbit, to Bamm Bamm. “Look, Bamm Bamm! Isn’t Hoppy fun?” cheered Barney, his eyes sparkling with joy. But Hoppy was full of energy! He hopped and bounced everywhere, causing chaos! “Oh no!” cried Betty as Hoppy zoomed past Wilma, who was watering her flowers. “Watch out, Wilma!” yelled Fred, but it was too late—Hoppy knocked over a pot! “Yikes!” exclaimed Wilma, trying to catch her breath. Just then, Pebbles giggled, “Hoppy is so silly!” Dino, the playful pet dinosaur, wagged his tail and chased after Hoppy, barking happily. “Dino, come back!” Fred laughed, but Hoppy kept bouncing away! Soon, the whole neighborhood was in a tizzy as Hoppy dashed through Fred's yard, nearly knocking over bowling pins and causing Barney to trip! “I can’t believe this!” shouted Fred, his loud voice echoing. Barney looked worried. “I didn’t mean for this to happen, Fred!” he said, his cheerful smile fading. Wilma stepped in, calming everyone, “Let’s help Hoppy find a safe place to play.” Fred nodded, realizing that Hoppy just wanted to have fun. “You’re right, Wilma! Friends stick together, even when things get bouncy!” So, they all helped Hoppy settle in the yard, where he could hop freely without causing trouble. “Hooray for Hoppy!” cheered Pebbles, and everyone laughed as they watched the little rabbit play. In the end, Fred and Barney hugged, their friendship stronger than ever, while Wilma and Betty smiled, happy to have helped. “Let’s go bowling after we play with Hoppy!” Fred said, and everyone cheered, excited for a day filled with laughter and joy!",
