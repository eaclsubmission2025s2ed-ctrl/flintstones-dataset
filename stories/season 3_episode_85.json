  "full_story": "One sunny afternoon in Bedrock, Fred was stomping around the house, his face all scrunched up. \"Barney, you silly goose! How could you say Pebbles could talk? That’s just a crazy joke!\" he shouted, waving his arms like he was trying to swat away a pesky fly. Pebbles giggled, bouncing up and down, loving the excitement. Just then, Barney, with his big cheerful smile, knocked on the door. “Hey Fred! Let’s call a truce! I’ve got tickets to the big wrestling match!” he said, his eyes sparkling like stars. Fred’s frown turned upside down, and he exclaimed, “Wrestling? Oh boy!” They both jumped with joy! But, uh-oh! Fred needed a babysitter for Pebbles. He called a babysitter, but when she arrived, she started dancing and having a party instead of watching Pebbles! “Let’s sneak Pebbles to the wrestling match!” Barney suggested, his face lighting up with mischief. Fred thought for a moment and then said, “That’s a great idea!” Pebbles clapped her hands with glee. So off they went, Fred, Barney, and little Pebbles, tiptoeing past Wilma and Betty, who were giggling and shouting at the wrestling match on TV. “Shhh! Don’t tell them!” Fred whispered, and they dashed out the door, ready for an adventure filled with laughter and fun!",
