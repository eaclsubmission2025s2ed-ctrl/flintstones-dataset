  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Fred and Barney were bowling at the quarry, laughing and cheering each other on. “Strike!” Fred shouted, throwing his bowling ball down the lane. Suddenly, they heard a loud crash! It was J. Montague Gypsum, a fancy man who had tripped over his own feet. “Oh no! Are you okay?” Barney asked, rushing over. Fred, being impulsive, said, “We saved your life!” J. Montague, with a sly smile, replied, “Well, I guess you did! Now, I need someone to take care of me!” Fred and Barney exchanged worried glances, but they nodded, thinking it would be fun. \n\nBack at Fred and Wilma's house, Pebbles squealed, “Look, Mommy! A new friend!” Wilma smiled but raised an eyebrow at Fred. “Are you sure this is a good idea?” Fred shrugged, “What could go wrong?” Soon, J. Montague started giving silly orders. “Fetch me a snack, and turn on the TV!” he demanded, while Pebbles giggled and Dino wagged his tail excitedly. “This is not how you treat friends!” Betty said, crossing her arms. “We should show him kindness!” \n\nFred and Barney, feeling a bit guilty, came up with a plan. They decided to teach J. Montague the importance of friendship. “How about we all play a game?” Fred suggested. “Bowling!” shouted Barney. J. Montague hesitated, but when he saw Pebbles bouncing with excitement, he finally agreed. They rolled the balls, cheered, and even Dino joined in by fetching the stray balls! \n\nBy the end of the day, J. Montague laughed heartily and said, “I never had so much fun! Thank you for showing me what real friendship is!” Fred and Barney smiled, feeling proud. “See, Wilma? It turned out great!” she nodded with a warm smile. As the sun set, they all shared snacks and stories, knowing that friendship, fun, and a little kindness can change anyone’s heart!",
