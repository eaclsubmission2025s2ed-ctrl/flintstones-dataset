  "full_story": "Once upon a time in Bedrock, Fred and Barney were feeling a bit grumpy about their jobs at the quarry. “Let’s do something fun, Barney!” Fred exclaimed, his voice booming with excitement. “How about we buy a drive-in restaurant?” Barney’s eyes lit up, “That sounds great, Fred! But we’ll need some help!” They decided to hire two cheerful girls as bellhops, but little did they know their wives, Wilma and Betty, were listening nearby and thought something sneaky was going on! \n\n“Fred! Are you cheating on me?” Wilma gasped, her hands on her hips. “No way!” Fred shouted, waving his arms in the air. “We’re just starting a restaurant!” Meanwhile, Betty was just as worried, “Barney, tell me it’s not true!” But Barney smiled sheepishly, “It’s all just a big misunderstanding!” \n\nWhen Wilma and Betty discovered that their husbands had quit the quarry, they decided to find them. “We have to see what they’re up to!” Wilma said determinedly, and off they went! They followed the smell of delicious food until they found Fred and Barney flipping burgers at the drive-in. “What are you two doing here?” Wilma asked, hands on her hips again, her eyes narrowing slightly. \n\n“We thought we could cook and have fun!” Fred said, scratching his head. But soon, Fred and Barney realized they missed their old jobs, so they decided to go back to the quarry. “We learned our lesson!” Barney said, nodding his head. \n\nLater, when they went out to dinner, Wilma and Betty couldn’t help but giggle. “Look at those two!” Betty said, pointing at Fred and Barney, who were wearing funny hats and aprons. “They thought they could be restaurant stars!” Wilma laughed, and Fred and Barney turned red, but they couldn’t help laughing too. They all realized that family and friends were the most important, and sometimes a little adventure is just what you need to appreciate what you have! And with that, they enjoyed a delicious dinner together, filling the air with laughter and love in Bedrock.",
