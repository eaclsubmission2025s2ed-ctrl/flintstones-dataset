Meanwhile, Wilma and Betty were in the kitchen, baking cookies and chatting. “Do you think Fred and Barney are really saying goodbye?” Wilma asked, raising an eyebrow, while Betty giggled, “Oh, they’re just being silly!” \n\nAt the party, everyone was having a blast! Fred bowled a strike, shouting, “Yes! Look at my bowling skills!” while Barney cheered, “Go, Fred, go!” Suddenly, a big sign popped up on the screen behind them: “Peek-A-Boo Camera!” Fred and Barney froze. “Oh no! Our wives will see us!” Fred gasped, his eyes wide. “We have to make sure they don’t!” Barney said, looking worried. They ran around, trying to hide behind the snacks and balloons, but nothing worked!\n\nBack at home, Pebbles was watching TV with Wilma and Betty, munching on cookies. “Mommy, look! It’s Daddy!” she squealed, pointing at the screen. Wilma and Betty both turned, and their eyes widened as they saw Fred and Barney doing silly dances. “Oh, those two!” Wilma laughed, shaking her head. “They can’t keep a secret!” \n\nJust then, Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, bounded into the room, wagging his tail. “Roooaaar!” he barked, and everyone laughed. Fred and Barney finally made it home, looking a bit sheepish. “We were just...uh...having fun!” Fred said with a grin, while Barney nodded eagerly. Wilma crossed her arms but smiled, “Well, you two certainly know how to throw a party!” Pebbles jumped up and down, “Can we have a party too?” And with that, they all laughed, feeling happy together, knowing that family and friendship make the best adventures!",
