Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, wagged his tail and barked happily. \"You can be our special helper, Dino!\" Fred said, giving him a big cuddle. \n\nFinally, it was showtime! The backyard was filled with colorful lights. Fred shouted, \"Lights, camera, action!\" as they began their play. Wilma kept everything on track, reminding them of their lines. \"Romeo, oh Romeo!\" Barney sang out, pretending to sigh dramatically. Pebbles flapped her arms and danced around, making everyone laugh. \n\nEven Mr. Slate, Fred's boss, came to watch, crossing his arms but smiling at the fun. “You all did a great job!” he said after the final bow. They all hugged, filled with joy and laughter. “What a fantastic day!” Wilma said, as they all agreed to put on another play soon.
