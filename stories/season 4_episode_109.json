  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred was bubbling with excitement as he shouted, “Hey, Barney! Let’s build a new room for my family!” Barney, always cheerful, replied, “That sounds fun, Fred! Let’s do it!” With big smiles, they grabbed their tools and got to work. Fred hammered and banged, while Barney held the boards, laughing, “This is going to be the best room ever!” But as they built, Fred got a little too carried away, and soon, they both started to argue. “That’s too close to my yard!” Barney exclaimed, pointing at a corner of the room. “No way! It’s just perfect!” Fred yelled back, his face scrunching up in frustration. As they stood there, frowning, Pebbles peeked out and said, “Daddy, why are you and Barney fighting?” With a sigh, Fred replied, “Because we both want the new room to be ours!” Just then, Dino bounded in, wagging his tail, and playfully bumped into Fred, causing him to giggle. “You know what, Barney? We can share the room!” Fred said, his loud voice brightening. “That’s a great idea!” Barney cheered, his eyes sparkling. Together, they finished building the room, and when it was done, they painted it bright blue with yellow stars. Wilma and Betty clapped with joy, saying, “It’s perfect for both families!” As the sun began to set, Fred and Barney smiled at each other, knowing that sharing was much better than fighting. And Dino barked happily, “Woof!” because everyone was friends again!",
