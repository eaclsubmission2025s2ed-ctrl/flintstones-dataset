  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was fixing a leaky pipe in his kitchen, but instead of fixing it, he made it worse! Water gushed everywhere! “Uh-oh!” Fred exclaimed, his eyes wide. “I think I need help!” Soon after, the Rubbles, Barney and Betty, had to move in with Fred and Wilma while a plumber worked on the problem. “Welcome to our home!” Wilma said with a smile, trying to keep everyone cheerful. Pebbles giggled and played with Dino, who wagged his tail excitedly, ready to greet his friends.\n\nBut as the days went by, things got a little messy. Barney, always cheerful, decided to help Fred fix things, but he accidentally knocked over the bowl of fruit! “Oops!” Barney laughed, picking up a banana that had rolled away. Fred sighed, “Barney, we need to be more careful!” Soon, Fred's patience began to wear thin. He stomped his foot, “Barney! Why can’t you just be a little more helpful?” Barney looked sad, “I just wanted to help, Fred!”\n\nMeanwhile, Betty, feeling overwhelmed, snapped at Wilma, “Why is it so hard to keep things tidy?” Wilma frowned, “I’m trying my best!” Their voices grew louder, and Pebbles looked worried, tugging on Dino’s tail. “Don’t fight, please!” she pleaded. Dino whimpered softly, sensing the tension.\n\nJust then, the plumber arrived with a loud knock. “I’m here to fix the plumbing!” he shouted happily. Fred and Barney exchanged worried glances, while Wilma and Betty nodded, realizing they needed to work together to keep things calm. “Alright, let’s all be a team!” Wilma suggested. With smiles, Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty joined forces to keep the house tidy and help the plumber. \n\nAs the week went on, they laughed more and fought less, discovering that teamwork made everything easier. Fred and Barney even bowled a few frames in the living room to cheer everyone up! “Strike!” Fred cheered, and everyone clapped. Finally, the plumbing was fixed, and the Rubbles could go back to their house. “Thanks for the fun week!” Betty said, hugging Wilma tightly. They all waved goodbye, promising to visit soon. Fred grinned, “Next time, let’s just stick to bowling!” And with that, they all shared a big laugh, knowing that family and friends make every adventure worth it!",
