  "full_story": "One sunny morning, Fred was whistling happily as he left for work at the quarry. He had a little extra money in his pocket, and he felt a bit cheeky. “Wilma, I’m off to a poker game with the guys!” he called, but inside, he was really going to the bowling alley instead. Wilma, with her calm and knowing smile, raised an eyebrow. “Just remember to be careful, Fred!” she said, a hint of worry in her voice. Fred waved her off, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt. As he arrived at the bowling alley, his cheerful friend Barney bounced over, “Hey, Fred! Ready to bowl?” Fred grinned, “Absolutely, Barney! But shhh, don’t tell Wilma!” They giggled and bowled strike after strike, while Pebbles cheered them on, her little hands clapping with joy. Meanwhile, back at home, Wilma and Betty were chatting, and Wilma mentioned Fred’s poker game. “I hope he’s being honest,” she sighed, while Betty nodded in agreement. Just then, Dino bounded into the room, wagging his tail and barking happily, ready to play! Wilma smiled at Dino, “You’re right, Dino! We should trust Fred.” But Fred was starting to feel nervous. What if Wilma found out the truth? Just then, he heard Barney say, “Hey Fred! Let’s go for one more round!” Fred felt a rush of fun, but deep down, he knew he had to come clean. So, with a big breath, he turned to Barney, “I need to tell Wilma the truth.” Barney’s eyes widened, “You’re right, Fred! Friends are honest!” Back at home, Fred walked in with a sheepish smile. “Wilma, I need to tell you something…” Wilma looked up, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. Fred confessed, “I wasn’t at a poker game. I went bowling instead, but I had so much fun!” Wilma smiled, relieved. “I’d rather you be honest, Fred!” she said, giving him a hug. “Next time, let’s all go bowling together!” Pebbles jumped up and down, “Yay! Bowling with everyone!” And Dino wagged his tail, ready for the fun. Fred realized that honesty was the best way to enjoy time with his family and friends. They all laughed together, and Fred promised never to hide the truth again.",
