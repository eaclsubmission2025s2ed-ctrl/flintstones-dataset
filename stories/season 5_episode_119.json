His cheerful daughter, Pebbles, had been talking about her favorite rodeo star, Bony Hurdle, all day! \"Daddy, Bony is the best! I want to be just like him!\" Pebbles exclaimed with bright, sparkling eyes. Fred, with his loud and impulsive personality, decided he needed to show Pebbles how much he loved her. \"I’ll enter the Bedrock Rodeo and win her heart!\" he announced with a big grin! \n\nWilma raised an eyebrow, but she knew Fred’s heart was in the right place. \"Just be careful, dear,\" she said calmly. Meanwhile, Barney, Fred's cheerful neighbor and best friend, jumped up excitedly. \"I’ll help you, Fred! We can disguise you!\" Betty, his sensible wife, nodded in agreement, \"That sounds like fun!\" \n\nThe next day, Fred put on a funny cowboy hat and a bright bandana to hide his face. \"I’m ready to ride!\" he boomed, as Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, encouraging Fred. At the rodeo, everyone cheered as Fred tried to ride a big, bucking bull. \"Yeehaw!\" he shouted, even though he wobbled a bit. Pebbles watched in awe, her eyes wide with excitement. \"Go, Daddy!\" she cheered, jumping up and down. \n\nFred gave it his all, but he fell off with a soft thud! The crowd gasped, but when he got back up, he laughed and waved. \"I’m okay!\" he called out, and everyone cheered for him. Pebbles clapped her little hands, her heart swelling with love for her brave dad. After the rodeo, Fred took off his disguise. \"I just wanted to show you how much I love you, Pebbles!\" he said with a smile. \n\nPebbles hugged him tightly, \"You’re my hero, Daddy!\" Wilma smiled proudly, and Barney cheered, \"What a great adventure!\" Even Mr. Slate, who had come to watch, chuckled, \"Well done, Fred!\" As the sun set over Bedrock, the family and friends celebrated with laughter, love, and ice cream, knowing that the best prize of all was being together.",
