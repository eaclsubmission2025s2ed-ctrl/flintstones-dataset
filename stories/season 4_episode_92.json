  "full_story": "Once upon a sunny day in Bedrock, Fred Flintstone was buzzing with excitement! He rushed to the store, thinking about the perfect gifts for his adorable daughter, Pebbles. “She’ll love these shiny blocks!” he boomed, forgetting that it was the anniversary of Dino's arrival instead. When he got home, Pebbles squealed with joy, but Dino, their playful pet dinosaur, felt left out. He huffed and puffed, his big, sad eyes looking up at Fred. “Uh-oh! Dino’s jealous!” Fred realized, scratching his head. To make it right, Fred grabbed Dino’s leash, saying, “Let’s go outside, buddy!” But when Fred woke up the next morning, Dino was missing! \n\n“Oh no!” shouted Fred, running to Barney’s house. “Dino’s gone! We need to find him!” Barney, always cheerful, nodded eagerly. “Let’s go, Fred!” Together, they searched high and low, asking everyone in Bedrock if they’d seen Dino. Suddenly, they heard a strange man say, “I’ve got a dancing dino named ‘Rocky’!” Fred and Barney exchanged worried glances. “That must be Dino!” Fred exclaimed. They raced to the man’s house to rescue him. \n\nThat night, after a wild chase with the cops, Fred and Barney found themselves in a courtroom! “This is a big mess!” Fred whispered nervously, scratching his head. Just then, the door flew open, and there was Dino, running in with a wagging tail, chased by dogcatchers! “Dino!” Pebbles cried, jumping up and down. Fred laughed and opened his arms wide. “You’re back, buddy!” But oh dear, Fred’s big mouth got him in trouble again! The judge, with a stern look, declared, “Fred, you’ll live in Dino’s doghouse for a week!” \n\n“Oh no!” Fred groaned, but then he grinned at Dino, who licked his face joyfully. “At least we’ll have fun together, right?” And so, the family learned that love and friendship always come first, even in a doghouse! With Pebbles giggling and Wilma shaking her head amusedly, Fred and Dino snuggled up in their cozy home, ready for more adventures. The End!",
