He accidentally grabbed the wrong pair—big, silly glasses that made everything look funny! “Look at me, Wilma!” Fred shouted, laughing as he looked in the mirror and saw his own goofy reflection. “I can see the world in a wobbly way!” Wilma smiled patiently, “Just remember to wear the right ones, Fred.” Later that day, the Flintstones and the Rubble family went to the circus. Pebbles bounced with excitement, her pigtails swaying as she shouted, “Look, Daddy! A monkey!” But Fred, with his silly glasses, squinted and shouted back, “Pebbles! Come here!” He waddled over, thinking the monkey was his little girl. The monkey swung down and chattered happily, making Fred scratch his head. “You’re not Pebbles!” he exclaimed, blinking in surprise. Just then, Barney laughed and said, “Fred, that’s a monkey!” Betty giggled, and even Wilma chuckled softly. Pebbles came running, her eyes sparkling. “Daddy! I’m over here!” Fred finally saw her and hugged her tight, “Oh, Pebbles! I’m so glad I found you!” Dino wagged his tail, barking happily, and the whole family laughed together. “Next time, I’ll wear the right glasses!” Fred promised, and they all enjoyed the circus, cheering for the monkeys and clapping for the clowns, knowing that family and friends made every adventure special!",
