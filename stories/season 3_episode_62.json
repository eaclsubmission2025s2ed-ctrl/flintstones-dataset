  "full_story": "One sunny morning in Bedrock, Fred was at the quarry, excitedly getting ready for the day. “Hey, Dino!” he shouted, petting his playful dinosaur, who wagged his tail like a dog. But Fred's smile faded when he heard the news: Barney had been laid off! “Oh no! My best buddy needs a job!” Fred exclaimed. That afternoon, Fred rushed to tell Barney, “Come work with me at the quarry!” Barney’s eyes sparkled with joy, “Really? That would be so fun!” They hopped in Fred's car, laughing and singing all the way to work. But when they arrived, something surprising happened: Mr. Slate announced that Barney would be promoted to be Fred’s boss! Fred’s face turned blue with jealousy, “But I’ve been here longer!” Wilma, always calm and smart, whispered to Fred, “Remember, it’s great to support your friend.” So, Fred took a deep breath and smiled, “Okay, Barney! Let’s be the best team!” Pebbles cheered, “Yay, Daddy and Uncle Barney!” Dino danced around happily. They worked together, and soon Fred realized that having Barney as a boss wasn’t so bad after all. He learned that friendship and teamwork were more important than being the boss. At the end of the day, as the sun set over Bedrock, Fred and Barney shared a big laugh, knowing they could always count on each other.",
