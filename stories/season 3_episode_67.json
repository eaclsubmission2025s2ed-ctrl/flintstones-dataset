  "full_story": "Once upon a time in the bustling town of Bedrock, Fred was bursting with excitement. “Barney! Guess what? We’re going to Frantic City for a big Water Buffalo convention!” he shouted, his voice echoing through the neighborhood. Fred’s best friend, Barney, jumped up with glee, his cheerful laughter filling the air. “Yippee! Three days of fun!” he exclaimed, clapping his hands. But Fred had a secret plan – he wanted to surprise Wilma with a talking dodo bird named Doozy! “She’ll love it!” he said with a big grin.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilma, Fred’s calm and sensible wife, was busy baking cookies with Betty, Barney’s kind and friendly wife. “Oh, I wonder what Fred is up to,” Wilma said, stirring the cookie dough. Just then, a sneaky plumber dressed as a doctor came by. “Ladies, your husbands need a break! Let them go to Frantic City!” he said, winking. Wilma and Betty exchanged glances and nodded, thinking it was a good idea.\n\nThe next day, Fred, Barney, and their friends packed their bags and set off, leaving behind a big surprise for their wives. “Dino, watch the house!” Fred called to their playful pet dinosaur, who wagged his tail happily. But Doozy, the talking dodo bird, had plans of his own. “Hey, Wilma! Fred is off to Frantic City for a convention!” he squawked. Wilma’s eyes widened. “Oh no! We can’t let them have all the fun!” she declared. \n\nWith Betty and the other Water Buffalo wives, they quickly jumped into a car and zoomed off to Frantic City. “Let’s catch them!” Betty cheered, her eyes sparkling with excitement. When they arrived, Fred and Barney were busy playing games and having a blast. “Look, Fred! Isn’t this fun?” Barney said, tossing a bowling ball down the lane. But then they heard a familiar voice. “Fred! Barney! We’re here!” Wilma shouted, waving her arms.\n\nFred's face turned bright red. “Uh-oh! I didn’t think they would come!” he stammered. Wilma, Betty, and the others joined in the fun, bowling with the boys and laughing together. “This is way better than just the boys!” Wilma said, smiling at Fred. They all cheered as they played, their laughter echoing in the bright city.\n\nIn the end, they realized that adventures are best when shared with family and friends. “Thanks for the surprise, Wilma!” Fred said, hugging her tightly. With Doozy clapping his wings, they all agreed that Frantic City was a wonderful place to make happy memories together. And they all lived happily ever after, enjoying every moment side by side.",
