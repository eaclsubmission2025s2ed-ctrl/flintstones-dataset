  "full_story": "One sunny day in Bedrock, Fred Flintstone was walking home from the quarry when, oh no! A sneaky mugger appeared! Fred shouted, “Hey, stop right there!” but the mugger ran away with Fred’s lunch money! When he got home, Fred was worried Wilma would think he was a coward. “I need to prove I’m brave!” he declared, puffing out his chest. Wilma, with a calm smile, said, “You’re brave in your own way, Fred.” But Fred didn’t hear her. He decided to catch the mugger using his favorite bowling ball! “I’ll be like a superhero!” he cheered. Fred and Barney, his cheerful friend, set off on their adventure. “Let’s reenact the crime!” Fred said, pretending to be the mugger while Barney giggled. They tripped over each other, and even Arnold the newsboy flipped over laughing! \n\nNext, Fred thought, “If I can’t catch the mugger, I’ll fight the prizefighter, Sonny Dempstone!” Wilma shook her head but smiled, knowing Fred meant well. “Be careful, Fred!” she called after him. At the boxing ring, Fred wore a silly pair of oversized gloves. “I’m tough!” he shouted, trying to impress Wilma. But when Sonny Dempstone stepped into the ring, Fred’s knees wobbled like jelly! \n\nJust then, Pebbles, Fred’s cheerful little girl, waved her arms. “Go, Daddy, go!” she cheered, her eyes sparkling with excitement. With a deep breath, Fred said, “I can do this!” But instead of fighting, he tamed a circus tiger that accidentally wandered in, making everyone gasp! “Wow, Fred!” Barney exclaimed, wide-eyed. \n\nLater, Fred returned home, tired but happy. “I didn’t catch the mugger, but I tamed a tiger!” he proudly announced. Wilma chuckled, “You’re brave and silly, Fred. That’s what we love about you!” Dino wagged his tail, barking joyfully, and Pebbles hugged her dad. Fred realized that being brave isn’t just about catching bad guys; it’s about being loved by his family. And with laughter in the air, they all enjoyed a big dinner together, with Fred promising to be a little more careful next time!",
